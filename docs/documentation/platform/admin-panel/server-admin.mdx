The Server Admin Console provides **server administrators** with the ability to
customize settings and manage configurations for their entire Infisical instance.

<Note>
  The first user to setup an account on your Infisical instance is designated as
  the server administrator by default.
</Note>

## Accessing the Server Admin Console

Navigate to the Server Admin Console by clicking on the **Server Console** button in the navigation bar.

### Allow User Signups

User signups are enabled by default, allowing **Anyone** with access to your instance to sign up. This can alternatively be **Disabled** to prevent any users from signing up.

### Restrict Signup by Email Domain(s)

Signup can be restricted to users matching one or more email domains, such as your organization's domain, to control who has access to your instance.

### Default Organization

If you're using SAML/LDAP/OIDC for only one organization on your instance, you can specify a default organization to use at login to skip requiring users to manually enter the organization slug.

### Trust Emails

By default, users signing up through SAML/LDAP/OIDC will still need to verify their email address to prevent email spoofing. This requirement can be skipped by enabling the switch to trust logins through the respective method.

### Notices

#### Auth Consent Content

Auth consent content is displayed to users on the login page. They can be used to display important information to users, such as a maintenance message or a new feature announcement. Both HTML and Markdown formatting are supported, allowing for customized styling like below:

```
**You are entering a confidential website**
```

```html
<div style="font-weight: bold;">You are entering a confidential website</div>
```

#### Page Frame Content

Page frame content is displayed as a header and footer in ALL protected pages. Like the auth consent content, both HTML and Markdown formatting are supported here as well.

## Environment Variables Tab

The Environment Variables tab allows server admins to override environment variables without direct access to the server's environment configuration. This is particularly useful for managed deployments or when you cannot directly modify environment files.

### When to Use Environment Overrides

Use this feature when:

- You don't have direct access to modify environment variables on your server
- You want to update configuration without redeploying your instance

### How It Works

1. Navigate to the Environment Variables tab in the Server Admin Console
2. Search for specific variables using the search bar
3. Modify the values as needed
4. Click Save to apply the changes

<Warning>
  Changes to environment variables can take up to 5 minutes to propagate across
  all containers in your deployment.
</Warning>
