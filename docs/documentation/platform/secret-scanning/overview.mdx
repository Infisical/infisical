## Introduction

Monitor and detect exposed secrets across your data sources, including code repositories, with Infisical Secret Scanning.

For additional security, we recommend using our [CLI Secret Scanner](/cli/scanning-overview#automatically-scan-changes-before-you-commit) to check for exposed secrets before pushing your code changes.

<Note>
    Secret Scanning is a paid feature.
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

## How Secret Scanning Works

Secret Scanning consists of several components that enable you to quickly respond to secret leaks:

- **Scanner Engine**: The core component that analyzes your code and detects potential secrets using pattern matching and entropy analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides continuous surveillance of your repositories for immediate detection of exposed secrets
- **Alert System**: Notifies organization admins via email when secrets are detected
- **Risk Management**: Allows tracking and managing detected secrets with different status options
- **Data Sources**: Integrates with various data sources and version control systems
- **Customizable Rules**: Supports ignore patterns and custom configurations to reduce false positives

These components work together to provide comprehensive secret detection and incident response capabilities.

### Data Sources

Data sources are configured integrations with external platforms, such as a GitHub organization or a GitLab group, that establish secure connections for scanning purposes using [App Connections](/integrations/app-connections/overview).

A data source acts as a secure intermediary between the external system and the scanner engine. It manages a collection of scannable resources (such as repositories) and handles the authentication and communication required for scanning operations.

### Resources

Resources are the atomic, scannable units, such as a repository, that can be monitored for secret exposure. Resources are added automatically when a data source is scanned and updated when scanning events are triggered, such as when a user pushes changes to GitHub.

Each resource maintains its own scanning history and status, allowing for granular monitoring and management of secret scanning across your organization.

### Scans

Scans can be initiated in two ways:

1. **Full Scan** - Manually triggered scan that comprehensively checks either all resources associated with a data source or a single selected resource.

2. **Diff Scan** - Automatically executed when **Auto-Scan** is enabled on a data source. This scan type specifically focuses on updates to existing resources.

All scan activities can be monitored in real-time through the Infisical UI, which displays:
- Current scan status
- Timestamp of the scan
- Resource(s) being scanned
- Detection results (whether any secrets were found)

### Findings

Findings are automatically generated when secret leaks are detected during scanning operations. Each finding contains comprehensive information including:
- The specific scanning rule that identified the leak
- File location and line number where the secret was found
- Resource-specific details (e.g., commit hash and author for Git repositories)

Findings are initially marked as **Unresolved** and can be updated to one of the following statuses with additional remarks:
- **Resolved** - The issue has been addressed
- **False Positive** - The detection was incorrect
- **Ignore** - The finding can be safely disregarded

These status options help teams effectively track and manage the lifecycle of detected secret leaks.

### Configuration

You can configure custom scanning rules and exceptions by updating your project's scanning configuration via the UI or API.

The configuration options allow you to:
- Define custom scanning patterns and rules
- Set up ignore patterns to reduce false positives
- Specify file path exclusions
- Configure entropy thresholds for secret detection
- Add allowlists for known safe patterns

For detailed configuration options, expand the example configuration below.

<Accordion title="Example Configuration">
    ```toml
    # Title for the configuration file
    title = "Some title"


    # This configuration is the foundation that can be expanded. If there are any overlapping rules
    # between this base and the expanded configuration, the rules in this base will take priority.
    # Another aspect of extending configurations is the ability to link multiple files, up to a depth of 2.
    # "Allowlist" arrays get appended and may have repeated elements.
    # "useDefault" and "path" cannot be used simultaneously. Please choose one.
    [extend]
    # useDefault will extend the base configuration with the default config:
    # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/cli/config/infisical-scan.toml
    useDefault = true
    # or you can supply a path to a configuration. Path is relative to where infisical cli
    # was invoked, not the location of the base config.
    path = "common_config.toml"

    # An array of tables that contain information that define instructions
    # on how to detect secrets
    [[rules]]

    # Unique identifier for this rule
    id = "some-identifier-for-rule"

    # Short human readable description of the rule.
    description = "awesome rule 1"

    # does not support lookaheads.
    regex = '''one-go-style-regex-for-this-rule'''

    # Golang regular expression used to match paths. This can be used as a standalone rule or it can be used
    # in conjunction with a valid `regex` entry.
    path = '''a-file-path-regex'''

    # Array of strings used for metadata and reporting purposes.
    tags = ["tag","another tag"]

    # A regex match may have many groups, this allows you to specify the group that should be used as (which group the secret is contained in)
    # its entropy checked if `entropy` is set.
    secretGroup = 3

    # Float representing the minimum shannon entropy a regex group must have to be considered a secret.
    # Shannon entropy measures how random a data is. Since secrets are usually composed of many random characters, they typically have high entropy
    entropy = 3.5

    # Keywords are used for pre-regex check filtering.
    # If rule has keywords but the text fragment being scanned doesn't have at least one of it's keywords, it will be skipped for processing further.
    # Ideally these values should either be part of the identifier or unique strings specific to the rule's regex
    # (introduced in v8.6.0)
    keywords = [
        "auth",
        "password",

        '''endpoint''',
    ]


    # This is a global allowlist which has a higher order of precedence than rule-specific allowlists.

## Ignoring Known Secrets
If you're intentionally committing a test secret that the secret scanner might flag, you can instruct Infisical to overlook that secret with the methods listed below.

### infisical-scan:ignore

To ignore a secret contained in line of code, simply add `infisical-scan:ignore ` at the end of the line as comment in the given programming.

```js example.js
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ"); // infisical-scan:ignore
}
```

### .infisicalignore
An alternative method to exclude specific findings involves creating a .infisicalignore file at your repository's root.
You can then add the fingerprints of the findings you wish to exclude. The [Infisical scan](/cli/scanning-overview) report provides a unique Fingerprint for each secret found.
By incorporating these Fingerprints into the .infisicalignore file, Infisical will skip the corresponding secret findings in subsequent scans.

```.ignore .infisicalignore
