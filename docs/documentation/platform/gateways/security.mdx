The Infisical Gateway enables secure access to private resources using SSH reverse tunnels, certificate-based authentication, and a comprehensive PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) system. The architecture provides end-to-end encryption and complete tenant isolation through multiple certificate authorities.

## Security Model Overview

### Certificate Architecture

The gateway system uses multiple certificate authorities depending on deployment configuration:

**For Organizations Using Infisical-Managed Relays:**

- **Instance relay SSH Client CA & Server CA** - Gateway ↔ Infisical Relay Server authentication
- **Instance relay PKI Client CA & Server CA** - Platform ↔ Infisical Relay Server authentication
- **Organization Gateway Client CA & Server CA** - Platform ↔ Gateway authentication

**For Organizations Using Customer-Deployed Relays:**

- **Organization relay SSH Client CA & Server CA** - Gateway ↔ Customer Relay Server authentication
- **Organization relay PKI Client CA & Server CA** - Platform ↔ Customer Relay Server authentication
- **Organization Gateway Client CA & Server CA** - Platform ↔ Gateway authentication

### Certificate Hierarchy

```
Instance Level (Shared Relays):
├── Instance Relay SSH CA (Gateway ↔ Relay)
├── Instance Relay PKI CA (Platform ↔ Relay)

Organization Level:
├── Organization Relay SSH CA (Gateway ↔ Org Relay)
├── Organization Relay PKI CA (Platform ↔ Org Relay)
└── Organization Gateway CA (Platform ↔ Gateway)
```

## Communication Security

### 1. Gateway Registration

When a gateway is first deployed:

1. Authenticates with Infisical using machine identity token
2. Receives SSH certificates for relay server authentication
3. Establishes SSH reverse tunnel to assigned relay server
4. Certificate issuance varies by relay configuration:
   - **Infisical-managed relay**: Receives Instance relay SSH client certificate + Instance relay SSH Server CA
   - **Customer-deployed relay**: Receives Organization relay SSH client certificate + Organization relay SSH Server CA

### 2. SSH Tunnel Authentication

Gateway ↔ Relay Server communication uses SSH certificate authentication:

- **Gateway Authentication**:

  - Presents SSH client certificate (Instance or Organization relay SSH Client CA)
  - Certificate contains gateway identification and permissions
  - Relay server validates certificate against appropriate SSH Client CA

- **Relay Server Authentication**:
  - Presents SSH server certificate (Instance or Organization relay SSH Server CA)
  - Gateway validates certificate against appropriate SSH Server CA
  - Ensures gateway connects to legitimate relay infrastructure

### 3. Platform-to-Gateway Direct Connection

The platform establishes secure direct connections with gateways through a **TLS-pinned tunnel** mechanism:

1. **TLS-Pinned Tunnel Establishment**:

   - Gateway initiates outbound connection to platform through SSH reverse tunnel
   - Platform establishes direct mTLS connection with gateway using Organization Gateway certificates
   - TLS certificate pinning ensures the connection is bound to the specific gateway identity
   - No inbound connections required - all communication flows through the outbound tunnel

2. **Connection Flow**:

   ```
   Platform ←→ [TCP with TLS] ←→ Relay ←→ [SSH Reverse Tunnel] ←→ Gateway
   ```

   - Gateway maintains persistent outbound SSH tunnel to relay server
   - Platform connects to relay server using TCP with TLS
   - Relay routes encrypted traffic between platform and gateway
   - TLS handshake occurs between platform and gateway through the relay
   - Application traffic flows through the TLS-pinned tunnel via relay routing

3. **Security Benefits**:
   - **No inbound connections**: Gateway never needs to accept incoming connections
   - **Certificate-based authentication**: Uses Organization Gateway certificates for mutual TLS
   - **Double encryption**: TLS traffic within SSH tunnel provides layered security
   - **Relay server isolation**: Relay cannot decrypt either TLS or application data
   - **Tenant isolation**: Each organization's traffic flows through separate authenticated channels

## Tenant Isolation

### Multi-Layer Certificate Isolation

The architecture provides tenant isolation through multiple certificate authority layers:

- **Instance-level CAs**: Shared relay infrastructure uses instance-level certificates
- **Organization-level CAs**: Each organization has unique certificate authorities
- **Relay deployment flexibility**: Organizations can choose shared or dedicated relay infrastructure
- **Cryptographic separation**: Cross-tenant communication is cryptographically impossible

### Authentication Flows by Deployment Type

**Infisical-Managed Relay Deployments:**

- Gateway authenticates with relay using Instance relay SSH certificates
- Platform authenticates with relay using Instance relay PKI certificates
- Platform authenticates with gateway using Organization Gateway certificates

**Customer-Deployed Relay Deployments:**

- Gateway authenticates with relay using Organization relay SSH certificates
- Platform authenticates with relay using Organization relay PKI certificates
- Platform authenticates with gateway using Organization Gateway certificates

### Resource Access Control

1. **Certificate Validation**:

   - All connections require valid certificates from appropriate CAs
   - Embedded certificate details control access permissions
   - Ephemeral certificate validation ensures time-bound access

2. **Network Isolation**:
   - Each organization's traffic flows through isolated certificate-authenticated channels
   - Relay servers route traffic based on certificate validation without content access
   - Gateway validates all incoming connections against Organization Gateway Client CA
