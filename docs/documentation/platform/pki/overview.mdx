Infisical can be used to create and manage Certificate Authorities (CAs) and issue X.509 certificates. This allows you to manage PKI infrastructure and issue digital certificates for subscribers such as services, applications, and devices.

Infisical's Certificate Authority capabilities include:

- **Acting as a Private CA**: Create and manage your own internal Certificate Authority hierarchy, including root and intermediate CAs
- **Integrating with External CAs**: Connect to external Certificate Authorities (such as public CAs or enterprise CAs) to issue certificates while maintaining centralized management

Infisical's PKI offering is split into three components:

- [Certificate Authorities](/documentation/platform/pki/private-ca): Create and manage private CAs, including root and intermediate CAs, or integrate with [external CAs](/documentation/platform/pki/external-ca).
- [Subscribers](/documentation/platform/pki/subscribers): Define and manage entities that will request X.509 certificates from CAs. This module provides a centralized view of all subscribers, enabling you to issue certificates and monitor their status.
- [Certificates](/documentation/platform/pki/certificates): Track and monitor issued X.509 certificates, maintaining a comprehensive inventory of all active and expired certificates.
