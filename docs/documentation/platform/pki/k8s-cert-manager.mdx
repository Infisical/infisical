description: "Learn how to automatically provision and manage TLS certificates in Kubernetes using Infisical PKI"

## Concept

The Infisical PKI provides ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) integration, enabling various ACME clients to issue and renew certificates automatically.
In Kubernetes environments, [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is the most popular tool for issuing certificates via ACME.
The issuer is perfect at obtaining X.509 certificates for Ingresses and other Kubernetes resources and can automatically renew them before expiration.

The typical workflow involves installing `cert-manager` and configuring resources that represent the connection details to your Infisical PKI as well as the certificates you want to issue.
Each issued certificate and its corresponding private key are stored in a Kubernetes `Secret`.

We recommend reading the official [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) for a complete overview.
For the ACME-specific configuration, refer to the [ACME section](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/).

## Workflow

A typical workflow for using cert-manager with Infisical PKI via ACME consists of the following steps:

1. Create a certificate profile in Infisical with ACME as the enrollment method.
2. Install `cert-manager` in your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Create a Kubernetes `Secret` containing the EAB (External Account Binding) credentials for the ACME certificate profile.
4. Create an `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer` resource that connects to the desired Infisical PKI certificate profile.
5. Create a `Certificate` resource defining the certificate you wish to issue and the target `Secret` where the certificate and private key will be stored.
6. Use the resulting Kubernetes `Secret` in your Ingresses or other resources.

## Guide

The following steps show how to install cert-manager (using `kubectl`) and obtain certificates from Infisical PKI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a certificate profile with ACME as the enrollment method in Infisical">

    Follow the instructions [here](/documentation/platform/pki/enrollment-methods/acme) to create a certificate profile that uses ACME enrollment.

    After completion, you will have the following values:
    - **ACME Directory URL**
    - **EAB Key ID (KID)**
    - **EAB Secret**

    These will be needed in later steps.

    <Note>
      Currently, the Infisical PKI ACME server only supports authentication via dedicated EAB credentials generated per certificate profile.

      Support for [Kubernetes Auth](/documentation/platform/identities/kubernetes-auth) is planned for the near future.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install cert-manager">

    Install cert-manager in your Kubernetes cluster by following the official guide [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) or by applying the manifest directly:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.15.3/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Kubernetes Secret for the Infisical ACME EAB credentials">
    Create a Kubernetes `Secret` that contains the **EAB Secret (HMAC key)** obtained in step 1.
    cert-manager uses this secret to authenticate with the Infisical ACME server via External Account Binding (EAB).

    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="kubectl command">
            ```bash
            kubectl create secret generic infisical-acme-eab-secret \
                --namespace <namespace_you_want_to_issue_certificates_in> \
                --from-literal=eabSecret=<eab_secret>
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="Configuration file">
            ```yaml acme-eab-secret.yaml
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
            metadata:
                name: infisical-acme-eab-secret
                namespace: <namespace_you_want_to_issue_certificates_in>
            data:
                eabSecret: <eab_secret>
            ```

            ```bash
            kubectl apply -f acme-eab-secret.yaml
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the cert-manager Issuer connecting to Infisical ACME server">
    Next, create the cert-manager Issuer or ClusterIssuer by filling out `acme_server_url`, `your_email`, `acme_eab_kid`, and applying the following configuration file for the `Issuer` resource.
    This configuration file specifies the connection details to your Infisical PKI CA to be used for issuing certificates.

    ```yaml infisical-issuer.yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Issuer
    metadata:
        name: issuer-infisical
    spec:
        acme:
            # the URL of your Infisical certificate profile with
            # ACME enrollment method from step 1
            server: <acme_server_url>
            # your email address, any email could work.
            # currently we just ignore the value
            email: <your_email>
            externalAccountBinding:
                keyID: <acme_eab_kid> # the EAB secret value from step 1
            keySecretRef: # reference to the Secret created in step 3
                name: "issuer-infisical-client-secret"
                key: "clientSecret"
            privateKeySecretRef:
                name: issuer-infisical-account-key
            solvers:
            - http01:
                ingress:
                    # this doesn't need to be nginx, you can use any
                    # ingressClassName available in your Kubernetes cluster
                    ingressClassName: nginx
    ```

    ```
    kubectl apply -f infisical-issuer.yaml
    ```

    You can check that the issuer was created successfully by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get issuers.cert-manager.io -n <namespace_of_issuer> -o wide
    ```

    ```bash
    NAME               AGE
    issuer-infisical   21h
    ```

    <Note>
        An `Issuer` is a namespaced resource, and it is not possible to issue certificates from an `Issuer` in a different namespace.
        This means you will need to create an `Issuer` in each namespace you wish to obtain `Certificates` in.

        If you want to create a single `Issuer` that can be consumed in multiple namespaces, you should consider creating a `ClusterIssuer` resource. This is almost identical to the `Issuer` resource, however is non-namespaced so it can be used to issue `Certificates` across all namespaces.

        You can read more about the `Issuer` and `ClusterIssuer` resources [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/).

        Also, currently Infisical ACME server only supports HTTP-01 and requires all the certificate orders passing the challenge before issuing certificates.
        We will allow users to opt-out challenge in the near future and also provide support DNS-01 as well.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Certificate">

    Finally, create a `Certificate` by applying the following configuration file.
    This configuration file specifies the details of the (end-entity/leaf) certificate to be issued.

    ```yaml certificate-issuer.yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
        name: certificate-by-issuer
        namespace: <namespace_you_want_to_issue_certificates_in>
    spec:
        # the common name for the certificate
        commonName: certificate-by-issuer.example.com
        # the name of the Kubernetes Secret to create and store
        # the certificate and private key in
        secretName: certificate-by-issuer
        issuerRef:
            name: issuer-infisical
            group: issuers.cert-manager.io
            kind: Issuer
        # the algorithm and key size to use
        privateKey:
            algorithm: ECDSA
            size: 256
        # the ttl for the certificate
        duration: 48h
        # the time before the certificate expiry that the certificate should
        # be automatically renewed
        renewBefore: 12h
    ```

    The above sample configuration file specifies a certificate to be issued with the common name `certificate-by-issuer.example.com` and ECDSA private key using the P-256 curve, valid for 48 hours; the certificate will be automatically renewed by `cert-manager` 12 hours before expiry.
    The certificate is issued by the issuer `issuer-infisical` created in the previous step and the resulting certificate and private key will be stored in a secret named `certificate-by-issuer`.

    Note that the full list of the fields supported on the `Certificate` resource can be found in the API reference documentation [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/reference/api-docs/#cert-manager.io/v1.CertificateSpec).

    You can check that the certificate was created successfully by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get certificates -n <namespace_of_your_certificate> -o wide
    ```

    ```bash
    NAME                    READY   SECRET                  ISSUER             STATUS                                          AGE
    certificate-by-issuer   True    certificate-by-issuer   issuer-infisical   Certificate is up to date and has not expired   20h
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Certificate in Kubernetes Secret">
    Since the actual certificate and private key are stored in a Kubernetes secret, we can check that the secret was created successfully by running the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret certificate-by-issuer -n <namespace_of_your_certificate>
    ```

    ```bash
    NAME                    TYPE                DATA   AGE
    certificate-by-issuer   kubernetes.io/tls   2      26h
    ```

    We can `describe` the secret to get more information about it:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe secret certificate-by-issuer -n default
    ```

    ```bash
    Name:         certificate-by-issuer
    Namespace:    default
    Labels:       controller.cert-manager.io/fao=true
    Annotations:  cert-manager.io/alt-names:
                cert-manager.io/certificate-name: certificate-by-issuer
                cert-manager.io/common-name: certificate-by-issuer.example.com
                cert-manager.io/ip-sans:
                cert-manager.io/issuer-group: issuers.cert-manager.io
                cert-manager.io/issuer-kind: Issuer
                cert-manager.io/issuer-name: issuer-infisical
                cert-manager.io/uri-sans:

    Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

    Data
    ====
    ca.crt: 1306 bytes
    tls.crt: 2380 bytes
    tls.key:  227 bytes
    ```

    Here, `ca.crt` is the Root CA certificate, `tls.crt` is the requested certificate followed by the certificate chain, and `tls.key` is the private key for the certificate.

    We can decode the certificate and print it out using `openssl`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret certificate-by-issuer -n default -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 --decode | openssl x509 -text -noout
    ```

    In any case, the certificate is ready to be used as Kubernetes Secret by your Kubernetes resources.
