## Concept

A certificate is the actual X.509 certificate issued for a certificate profile.

Once issued, a certificate is kept track of in the certificate inventory
where you can manage various aspects of its lifecycle including deployment to cloud key stores, server-side auto-renewal behavior, revocation, and more.
