## Concept

A certificate profile is a configuration set specifying how leaf certificates should be issued for a group of end-entities including the [issuing CA](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/overview), a [certificate template](/documentation/platform/pki/certificates/templates), and the enrollment method (e.g. ACME, EST, API, etc.) used to enroll certificates.

You typically request certificates against a certificate profile through its associated enrollment method. Each method defines its own interaction flow which you can read more about in its respective documentation.

## Guide to Creating a Certificate Profile

To create a certificate profile, head to your Certificate Management Project > Certificates > Certificate Profiles and press **Create Profile**.

Here's some guidance on each field:

- Name: A slug-friendly name for the profile such as `web-servers`.
- Description: An optional description for the profile.
- Issuing CA: The [issuing CA](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/overview) that should be used to issue certificates for the profile.
- Certificate Template: The [certificate template](/documentation/platform/pki/certificates/templates) that should be used to validate certificate requests for the profile.
- Enrollment Method: The enrollment method that should be used to enroll certificates for the profile such as ACME, EST, API, etc.

Depending on which enrollment method you choose, you may be presented with additional enrollment-specific configuration fields.
