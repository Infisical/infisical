## Concept

A certificate approval policy defines a workflow requiring human review before certificates are issued from specific [certificate profiles](/documentation/platform/pki/certificates/profiles). When a certificate request is made against a profile with an approval policy, the request is placed in a pending state until the required approvers review and approve it.

Approval workflows help enforce separation of duties, add oversight for sensitive certificate issuance, and meet compliance requirements that mandate review before certificate issuance.

Key features of approval policies include:

- **Multi-step workflows**: Configure sequential approval steps where each step must be completed before the next begins.
- **Flexible approvers**: Assign individual users or groups as eligible approvers for each step.
- **Required approval count**: Specify how many approvals are needed per step (e.g., require 2 out of 5 eligible approvers).
- **Approver notifications**: Optionally notify approvers when their approval is required.
- **Machine identity bypass**: Allow machine identities to issue certificates without approval for automated workloads.
- **Request expiration**: Set a maximum time-to-live (TTL) for pending requests.

## Guide to Creating an Approval Policy

To create an approval policy, head to your Certificate Management Project > Certificate Manager > Approvals > Policies and press **Create Policy**.

### Step 1: Configuration

Configure the basic policy settings:

- **Policy Name**: A descriptive name for the policy such as `production-cert-approval`.
- **Max. Request TTL**: The maximum time a request can remain pending before it expires (optional). Use duration format like `7d` for 7 days or `24h` for 24 hours.
- **Certificate Profiles**: Select one or more certificate profiles that this policy applies to. Any certificate request made against these profiles will require approval.
- **Bypass approval for machine identities**: When enabled, machine identities can issue certificates from the selected profiles without requiring approval. This is useful for automated workloads that need certificates without human intervention.

### Step 2: Approval Sequence

Configure the approval steps. Each step defines who can approve and how many approvals are required:

- **Step Name**: An optional name for the step such as `Security Team Review`.
- **Approvers**: Select individual users or groups who are eligible to approve this step. Multiple approvers can be selected.
- **Required Approvals**: The number of approvals needed to complete this step. For example, if you select 5 approvers and require 2 approvals, any 2 of the 5 can approve to complete the step.
- **Notify Approvers**: When enabled, eligible approvers receive a notification when their approval is required.

You can add multiple steps to create a sequential approval workflow. For example:
1. **Team Lead Review**: Requires 1 approval from the team leads group
2. **Security Review**: Requires 2 approvals from the security team

Each step must be completed in order before the certificate is issued.

### Step 3: Review

Review your policy configuration and click **Create** to save the policy.

## Guide to Managing Approval Requests

When a certificate request requires approval, it appears in the Approvals page under the Requests tab.

### Viewing Requests

Navigate to your Certificate Management Project > Certificate Manager > Approvals > Requests to view all approval requests. You can filter requests by status:

- **Open Requests**: Requests currently pending approval
- **Approved**: Requests that have been approved and certificates issued
- **Rejected**: Requests that were rejected by an approver
- **Cancelled**: Requests cancelled by the requester
- **Expired**: Requests that exceeded their maximum TTL

### Approving a Request

To approve a request:

1. Click on a pending request to view its details
2. Review the certificate request information including:
   - Requester name and email
   - Certificate profile
   - Common name and subject alternative names (SANs)
   - Key usages and extended key usages
   - Validity period
3. If you are an eligible approver for the current step, click **Approve** to approve the request
4. Optionally add a comment explaining your approval

Once all required approvals for all steps are obtained, the certificate is automatically issued.

### Rejecting a Request

To reject a request:

1. Click on a pending request to view its details
2. Review the certificate request information
3. If you are an eligible approver for the current step, click **Reject** to reject the request
4. Optionally add a comment explaining the rejection

When a request is rejected, the workflow ends and no certificate is issued.

<Note>
For automated workloads using Certbot or that cannot wait for human approval, consider enabling the **Bypass approval for machine identities** option on the approval policy.
