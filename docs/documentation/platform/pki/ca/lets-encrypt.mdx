## Concept

Infisical can connect to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using the [ACME-compatible CA integration](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/acme-ca) to issue certificates back to your end-entities.

## Guide to Connecting Infisical to Let's Encrypt CA

To connect Infisical to Let's Encrypt, follow the steps in the [ACME-compatible CA integration](/documentation/platform/pki/ca/acme-ca) guide but use the Let's Encrypt **ACME Directory URL**: `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`.

Note that Let’s Encrypt issues 90-day certificates and enforces a limit of 50 certificates per registered domain per week.

We strongly recommend testing your setup against the Let's Encrypt staging environment first at the **ACME Directory URL** `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory` prior to switching to the production environment. This allows you to verify your DNS configuration and certificate issuance process without consuming production rate limits.
