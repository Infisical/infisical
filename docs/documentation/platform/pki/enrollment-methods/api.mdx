        Enable Auto-Renewal: Whether or not to opt-in issued certificates for
        (server-side) auto-renewal.

        Auto-Renewal Days: The number of days before the certificate expires to
        trigger certificate renewal.

    <Note>
      Note that auto-renewal only applies to certificates issued through
      CSR-less enrollment where key generation is done internally by
      Infisical; conversely certificates issued via CSR submission are not eligible for auto-renewal.
