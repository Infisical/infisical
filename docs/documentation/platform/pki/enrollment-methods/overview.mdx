Enrollment methods determine how certificates are issued and managed for a [certificate profile](/documentation/platform/pki/certificates/profiles).

Refer to the documentation for each enrollment method below to learn more about how to enroll certificates using it.

- [API](/documentation/platform/pki/enrollment-methods/api): Enroll certificates via API.
- [ACME](/documentation/platform/pki/enrollment-methods/acme): Enroll certificates using the ACME protocol.
- [EST](/documentation/platform/pki/enrollment-methods/est): Enroll certificates using the EST protocol.

Note that beyond using an enrollment method, you can also deliver a certificate to a target destination using supported [certificate syncs](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/pki/certificate-syncs/overview).
