## Concept

In order to ensure that your certificates are always up-to-date and not expired, you can set up alerting in Infisical for expiring CA and leaf certificates based on customizable filters.

## Guide to Creating an Alert

To create an alert, head to your Certificate Management Project > Alerting and press **Create Certificate Alert**.

Here's some guidance for each field in the alert configuration sequence:

- Alert Type: The type of alert to create such as **Certificate Expiration**.
- Alert Name: A slug-friendly name for the alert such as `tls-expiry-alert`.
- Description: An optional description for the alert.
- Alert Before: The time before certificate expiration to trigger the alert such as 30 days denoted by `30d`.
- Filters: A list of filters that determine which certificates the alert applies to. Each row includes a **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value** to match against. For example, you can filter for certificates with a common name containing `example.com` by setting the field to **Common Name**, the operator to **Contains**, and the value to `example.com`.
- Channels / Email Recipients: A list of email addresses to notify when the alert triggers.
