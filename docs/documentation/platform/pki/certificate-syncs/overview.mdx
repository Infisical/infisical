Certificate Syncs enable you to sync certificates from Infisical PKI to third-party services using [App Connections](/integrations/app-connections/overview).

<Note>
    Certificate Syncs are designed to automatically deploy certificates issued by your Certificate Authority to external services, ensuring your certificates are always up-to-date across your infrastructure.
</Note>

## Concept

Certificate Syncs are a project-level resource used to sync certificates, via an [App Connection](/integrations/app-connections/overview), from a particular PKI subscriber (source)
to a third-party service (destination). When new certificates are issued or existing certificates are renewed, changes will automatically be propagated to the destination, ensuring
your certificates are always current.

## Workflow

Configuring a Certificate Sync requires three components: a <strong>source</strong> PKI subscriber to retrieve certificates from,
a <strong>destination</strong> endpoint to deploy certificates to, and <strong>configuration options</strong> to determine how your certificates
should be synced. Follow these steps to start syncing:

<Note>
    For step-by-step guides on syncing to a particular third-party service, refer to the Certificate Syncs section in the Navigation Bar.
</Note>

1. <strong>Create App Connection:</strong> If you have not already done so, create an [App Connection](/integrations/app-connections/overview)
via the UI or API for the third-party service you intend to sync certificates to.

2. <strong>Create Certificate Sync:</strong> Configure a Certificate Sync in the desired project by specifying the following parameters via the UI or API:
    - <strong>Source:</strong> The PKI subscriber you wish to retrieve certificates from.
    - <strong>Destination:</strong> The App Connection to utilize and the destination endpoint to deploy certificates to. These can vary between services.
    - <strong>Options:</strong> Customize how certificates should be synced, including:
      - Whether certificates should be removed from the destination when they expire
      - Certificate naming schema to control how certificate names are generated in the destination

<Note>
    Only certificates managed by Infisical will be affected during sync operations. Certificates not created or
    managed by Infisical will remain untouched, and changes made to Infisical-managed certificates directly
    in the destination service may be overwritten by future syncs.
</Note>

<Info>
    Some third-party services do not support removing expired certificates automatically.
</Info>

3. <strong>Utilize Sync:</strong> Any new certificates issued or renewals from the source PKI subscriber will now automatically be propagated to the destination endpoint.

<Note>
    Infisical is continuously expanding its Certificate Sync third-party service support. If the service you need isn't available,
    contact us at team@infisical.com to make a request.

## Certificate Naming

Certificate Syncs support flexible certificate naming through configurable naming schemas. This allows you to customize how certificate names appear in your destination services.

### Default Naming

By default, certificates are named using the pattern `Infisical-{certificateId}` where `{certificateId}` is the unique identifier of the certificate with hyphens removed for compatibility with services like Azure Key Vault.

### Custom Naming Schema

You can customize certificate naming by providing a **Certificate Name Schema** when creating or updating a Certificate Sync. The schema supports the following placeholders:

- `{{certificateId}}` - The unique certificate identifier (required)

**Examples:**
- `myapp-{{certificateId}}` → `myapp-abc123def456`
- `ssl/{{certificateId}}` → `ssl/abc123def456`

**Rules:**
- Must include exactly one `{{certificateId}}` placeholder
- Only alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), underscores (_), and slashes (/) are allowed
- Certificate names matching your schema will be managed by Infisical during sync operations

## Certificate Management

Certificate Syncs handle the full lifecycle of certificate management:

- **Automatic Deployment**: New certificates are automatically deployed to configured destinations
- **Renewal Propagation**: Certificate renewals are seamlessly pushed to all connected services
- **Expiration Handling**: Expired certificates can be automatically removed from destinations (service-dependent)
- **Certificate Validation**: Certificates are validated before deployment to ensure integrity
