Infisical can send PKI certificate alert notifications to a Slack channel using [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). This guide walks through creating a Slack app and configuring a Slack alert.

    Here's some guidance for each field in the alert configuration sequence:

    - **Alert Type**: The type of alert to create such as **Certificate Expiration**.
    - **Alert Name**: A slug-friendly name for the alert such as `tls-expiry-alert`.
    - **Description**: An optional description for the alert.
    - **Alert Before**: The time before certificate expiration to trigger the alert such as 30 days denoted by `30d`.
    - **Filters**: A list of filters that determine which certificates the alert applies to. Each row includes a **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value** to match against. For example, you can filter for certificates with a common name containing `example.com` by setting the field to **Common Name**, the operator to **Contains**, and the value to `example.com`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Slack Notification Channel">
    Add a **Slack** notification channel and paste the webhook URL you copied from Slack.

</Steps>

<Note>
Keep your webhook URL secure. Anyone with access to it can post messages to your Slack channel.
</Note>

Slack messages include alert details and the two most urgent expiring certificates, with a link to view all certificates in Infisical.
