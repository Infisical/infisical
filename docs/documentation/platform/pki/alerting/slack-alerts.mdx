    2. Select **From scratch**
    3. Give your app a name (e.g., "Infisical PKI Alerts") and select the Slack workspace where you want to receive notifications
    4. Click **Create App**

    3. Click **Add New Webhook** at the bottom of the page
    4. Select the channel where you want to receive alerts and click **Allow**
