      </Step>

    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted setup">
    ### Configure admin settings
    Note that this step only has to be done once for the entire instance.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to the Integrations tab in the Admin settings">
        Before anything else, you need to setup the Slack app to be used by
        your Infisical instance. Because you're self-hosting, you will need to
        create this Slack application as demonstrated in the preceding step.

        Click the **Create Slack app** button. This will open up a new window with the
        custom app creation flow on Slack.

        ![admin-settings-slack-overview](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-slack-integration-overview.png)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Slack app">
        Select the Slack workspace you want to integrate with Infisical.

        ![admin-slack-app-workspace-select](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-slack-integration-app-workspace-select.png)

        The configuration values of your custom Slack app will be pre-filled for you. You can view or edit the app manifest by clicking **Edit Configurations**.
        ![admin-slack-app-summary](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-slack-integration-app-summary.png)

        Once everything's confirmed, press Create.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Input app credentials from Slack">
        Copy the Client ID and Client Secret values from your newly created custom Slack app and add them to Infisical.
        ![admin-slack-app-credentials](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-slack-integration-app-credentials.png)
        ![admin-slack-app-credentials-form](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-slack-integration-app-credential-form.png)
        Complete the admin setup by pressing **Save**.
      </Step>

    </Steps>

    ### Configure GovSlack admin settings (Optional)

    If you're using GovSlack, you'll need to configure GovSlack credentials separately in the Admin settings.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to the Integrations tab in the Admin settings">
        In the Admin settings Integrations page, you'll see a separate **GovSlack** section below the Slack configuration.

        Click the **Create GovSlack App** button. This will open up a new window with the
        custom app creation flow on GovSlack at `https://api.slack-gov.com`.

        Select the GovSlack workspace you want to integrate with Infisical.

        ![admin-govslack-app-workspace-select](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-govslack-integration-app-workspace-select.png)


        The configuration values of your custom GovSlack app will be pre-filled for you, similar to the standard Slack app creation process.

        ![admin-govslack-app-summary](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/admin-govslack-integration-app-summary.png)

        Once everything's confirmed, press Create.

      <Step title="Input GovSlack app credentials">
        Copy the Client ID and Client Secret values from your newly created custom GovSlack app and add them to Infisical in the GovSlack section.

## Slack Events

The Slack integration supports the following events that can be configured for your projects. Each event is triggered when specific actions occur within your Infisical instance.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Access Request">
    ### Access Request
    This event is triggered when a user creates a new access approval request for a project. The notification includes details about the requester, the requested permissions, the secret path and environment, and whether the access is temporary or permanent.

    **When it's triggered:**
    - A user submits a new access approval request through the Infisical UI
    - The request requires approval based on configured access approval policies
    - The notification is sent to the configured access request channels

    **Notification includes:**
    - Requester's full name and email
    - Requested permissions (read, write, etc.)
    - Secret path and environment
    - Access type (temporary or permanent)
    - Optional user note
    - Direct link to review the request

    ![access request notification](/images/platform/workflow-integrations/slack-integration/access-request-notification.png)

    ### Access Request Updated
    This event is triggered when an existing access approval request is modified or updated. This helps approvers stay informed about changes to pending requests.

    **When it's triggered:**
    - An access approval request is edited by the requester or another authorized user
    - Changes are made to permissions, temporary range, or notes
    - The notification is sent to the configured access request channels

    **Notification includes:**
    - Original requester's information
    - Editor's full name and email (who made the update)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secret Approval">

    This event is triggered when a secret approval request is created. This occurs when a user attempts to create, update, or delete secrets that require approval based on secret approval policies.

    **When it's triggered:**
    - A user creates, updates, or deletes secrets in a path protected by a secret approval policy
    - The changes require approval before being applied
