<Info>
    SCIM provisioning is a paid feature.
    
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members be provisioned/deprovisioned using [SCIM](https://scim.cloud/#Implementations2) via providers like Okta, Azure, JumpCloud, etc.

- Provisioning: The SCIM provider pushes user information to Infisical. If the user exists in Infisical, Infisical sends an email invitation to add them to the relevant organization in Infisical; if not, Infisical initializes a new user and sends them an email invitation to finish setting up their account in the organization.
- Deprovisioning: The SCIM provider instructs Infisical to remove user(s) from an organization in Infisical.

SCIM providers:

- [Azure SCIM](/documentation/platform/scim/azure)
- [JumpCloud SCIM](/documentation/platform/scim/jumpcloud)

**FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do SCIM-provisioned users have to finish setting up their account?">
    Infisical's SCIM implementation accounts for retaining the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps in the platform. 
    
    For this reason, SCIM-provisioned users are initialized but must finish setting up their account when logging in the first time by creating a master encryption/decryption key. With this implementation, IdPs and SCIM providers cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
