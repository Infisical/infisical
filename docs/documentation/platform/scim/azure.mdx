<Info>
    Azure SCIM provisioning is a paid feature.
    
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

Prerequisites:
- [Configure Azure SAML for Infisical](/documentation/platform/sso/azure)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a SCIM token in Infisical">
        In Infisical, head to your Organization Settings > Security > SCIM Configuration and
        press the **Enable SCIM provisioning** toggle to allow Azure to provision/deprovision users for your organization.

        Next, press **Manage SCIM Tokens** and then **Create** to generate a SCIM token for Azure.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Users and Groups in Azure">
        In Azure, navigate to Enterprise Application > Users and Groups. Add any users and/or groups to your application that you would like
        to be provisioned over to Infisical.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure SCIM in Azure">
        In Azure, head to your Enterprise Application > Provisioning > Overview and press **Get started**.
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-get-started.png)

        Next, set the following fields:
        
        - Provisioning Mode: Select **Automatic**.
        - Tenant URL: Input **SCIM URL** from Step 1.
        - Secret Token: Input the **New SCIM Token** from Step 1.
        
        Afterwards, click **Enable SCIM** and press the **Test Connection** button to check that SCIM is configured properly.
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-config.png)
        
        After you hit **Save**, select **Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users** under the **Mappings** subsection.
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-select-user-mappings.png)
        
        Next, adjust the mappings so you have them configured as below:
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-user-mappings.png)

        Finally, head to your Enterprise Application > Provisioning and set the **Provisioning Status** to **On**.
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-provisioning-status.png)
        
        Alternatively, you can go to **Overview** and press **Start provisioning** to have Azure start provisioning/deprovisioning users to Infisical.
        
        ![SCIM Azure](/images/platform/scim/azure/scim-azure-start-provisioning.png)
        
        Now Azure can provision/deprovision users to/from your organization in Infisical.

**FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do SCIM-provisioned users have to finish setting up their account?">
    Infisical's SCIM implmentation accounts for retaining the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps in the platform. 
    
    For this reason, SCIM-provisioned users are initialized but must finish setting up their account when logging in the first time by creating a master encryption/decryption key. With this implementation, IdPs and SCIM providers cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
