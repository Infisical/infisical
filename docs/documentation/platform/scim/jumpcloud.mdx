        Next, set the following SCIM connection fields:
        
        - Base URL: Input the **SCIM URL** from Step 1.
        - Token Key: Input the **New SCIM Token** from Step 1.
        - Test User Email: Input a test user email to be used by JumpCloud for testing the SCIM connection.

        Alos, under HTTP Header > Authorization: Bearer, input the **New SCIM Token** from Step 1.

**FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do SCIM-provisioned users have to finish setting up their account?">
    Infisical's SCIM implmentation accounts for retaining the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps in the platform. 
    
    For this reason, SCIM-provisioned users are initialized but must finish setting up their account when logging in the first time by creating a master encryption/decryption key. With this implementation, IdPs and SCIM providers cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
