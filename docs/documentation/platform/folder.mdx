Infisical Folders enable users to organize secrets using custom structures dependent on the intended use case (also known as **path-based secret storage**). 

It is great for organizing secrets around hierarchies with multiple services or types of secrets involved at large quantities. 
Infisical Folders can be infinitely nested to mirror your application architecture – whether it's microservices, monorepos, 
or any logical grouping that best suits your needs.

Consider the following structure for a microservice architecture:

```
| service1
|---- envars
|---- users
|-------- tokens1
|-------- tokens2
| service2
|---- envars
...
```

In this example, we store environment variables for each microservice under each respective `/envars` folder. 
We also store user-specific secrets for micro-service 1 under `/service1/users`. With this folder structure in place, your applications only need to specify a path like `/microservice1/envars` to fetch secrets from there.
By extending this example, you can see how path-based secret storage provides a versatile approach to manage secrets for any architecture.

## Managing folders

To add a folder, press the downward chevron to the right of the **Add Secret** button; then press on the **Add Folder** button.

<Info>
  Folder names can only contain alphabets, numbers, and dashes

To delete a folder, hover over it and press the **X** button that appears on the right side.

### Comparing folders

It's possible to compare the contents of folders across environments in the **Secrets Overview** page.
When you click on a folder, the table will display the items within it across environments.

In the image below, you can see that the **Development** environment is the only one that contains items 
in the `/users` folder, being other folders `/user-a`, `/user-b`, ... `/user-f`.
