Infisical Agentic Manager enables organizations to securely connect AI agents and assistants to external tools through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It provides a centralized control plane for managing which tools AI systems can access, how they authenticate, and complete visibility into every tool invocation.

As AI agents become more capable and autonomous, organizations need robust infrastructure to govern their access to external systems. Agentic Manager solves this by acting as a secure gateway between AI clients (like Claude, ChatGPT, or custom agents) and the MCP servers that provide tools.
