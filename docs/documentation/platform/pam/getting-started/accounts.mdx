An account represents a specific set of credentials (e.g., a username and password) used to access a [resource](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources).

## Creating an Account

<Info>
    Before you can create an account, you must first [Create a Resource](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources#creating-a-resource).
</Info>

To add an account, navigate to the **Accounts** tab in your PAM project and click **Add Account**.

Next, select the resource where you want to add the account.

After selecting a resource, provide the necessary credentials. The required fields vary depending on the resource type. For example, an SSH resource needs the username and password for a Unix user.

Clicking **Create Account** triggers a validation check to verify the credentials. If the validation fails, an error message is displayed to help you troubleshoot.

## Automated Credential Rotation

Accounts for certain resources, such as PostgreSQL, support automated credential rotation.

You can enable rotation when creating or editing an account and set a desired interval (e.g., every 30 days). This option is only available if a [rotation account is configured](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources#automated-credential-rotation) on the resource.
