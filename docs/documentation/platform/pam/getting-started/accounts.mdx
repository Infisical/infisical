An **Account** represents a specific identity or set of credentials (username/password) used to authenticate against a [Resource](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources).

## Relationship to Resources

Accounts are children of Resources. A single Resource can have multiple Accounts associated with it, each with different permission levels.

For example:
- **Resource**: `Production Database` (PostgreSQL)
    - **Account 1**: `postgres` (Superuser)
    - **Account 2**: `app_user` (Read/Write)
    - **Account 3**: `analytics` (Read-only)

When a user requests access in PAM, they request access to a specific **Account** on a **Resource**.

## Creating an Account

<Info>
    **Prerequisite**: You must have at least one [Resource](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources) created before adding accounts.
</Info>

To add an account, navigate to the **Accounts** tab in your PAM project and click **Add Account**.

Next, select the **Resource** that this account belongs to.

After selecting a resource, provide the credentials (username, password, etc.) for this account. The required fields vary depending on the resource type. For example, for a Linux server, you would enter the username and the corresponding password or SSH key.

Clicking **Create Account** will trigger a validation check. Infisical will attempt to connect to the resource using the provided credentials to verify they are valid.

## Automated Credential Rotation

Accounts for certain resources, such as PostgreSQL, support automated credential rotation. This feature automatically changes the password for the account at a set interval.

**Requirements:**
1. The parent Resource must have a [Rotation Account](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources#automated-credential-rotation) configured (a master account with permission to change other users' passwords).
2. You must enable rotation in the Account settings.
