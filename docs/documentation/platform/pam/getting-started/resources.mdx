A resource represents a target system, such as a database, server, or application, that you want to manage access to. Some examples of resources are:
- PostgreSQL Database
- MCP Server
- Linux Server
- Web Application

## Prerequisites

Before you can create a resource, you must have an **Infisical Gateway** deployed that is able to reach the target resource over the network.

The Gateway acts as a secure bridge, allowing Infisical to reach your private infrastructure without exposing it to the public internet. When creating a resource, you will be asked to specify which Gateway should be used to connect to it.

[Read the Gateway Deployment Guide](/documentation/platform/gateways/gateway-deployment)

## Creating a Resource

To add a resource, navigate to the **Resources** tab in your PAM project and click **Add Resource**.

Next, select the type of resource you want to add.

![Select Resource Type](/images/pam/getting-started/resources/select-resource-type.png)

After selecting a resource type, provide the necessary connection details. The required fields vary depending on the resource type.

**Important**: You must select the **Gateway** that has network access to this resource.

In this PostgreSQL example, you provide details such as host, port, gateway, and database name.

![Create Resource](/images/pam/getting-started/resources/create-resource.png)

Clicking **Create Resource** will trigger a connection test from the selected Gateway to your target resource. If the connection fails, an error message will be displayed to help you troubleshoot (usually indicating a network firewall issue between the Gateway and the Resource).

## Automated Credential Rotation

Some resources, such as PostgreSQL, support automated credential rotation to enhance your security posture. This feature requires configuring a privileged "Rotation Account" on the resource.

To learn more about how to configure this, please refer to the [Credential Rotation guide](/documentation/platform/pam/product-reference/credential-rotation).
