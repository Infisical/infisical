Infisical PAM Web Access provides a browser-based portal for interacting with your infrastructure directly from your browser via the Infisical dashboard — no client tools or CLI required.

<Info>
  Web Access currently supports **PostgreSQL** databases and **SSH** servers.

## How It Works

When you open a web access session, Infisical establishes a secure WebSocket connection that tunnels through an Infisical Gateway to your target resource. All commands are executed server-side and streamed back to your browser in real time.

    participant Browser
    participant Infisical
    participant Gateway as Infisical Gateway
    participant Resource as Target Resource

    Browser->>Infisical: Request session ticket
    Infisical-->>Browser: One-time ticket
    Browser->>Infisical: Open WebSocket with ticket
    Infisical->>Gateway: Establish secure tunnel
    Gateway->>Resource: Connect with account credentials
    Browser->>Infisical: User input
    Infisical->>Gateway: Forward input
    Gateway->>Resource: Execute
    Resource-->>Browser: Streamed output
```

## Session Limits

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Max session duration** | 1 hour |
| **Idle timeout** | 5 minutes (resets on any input) |
| **Concurrent sessions** | 5 per user per project |

Sessions that exceed the idle timeout or max duration are automatically terminated.
