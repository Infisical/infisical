The SSH web access terminal provides a browser-based interactive shell for SSH servers. It is designed for quick interactive sessions — running commands, debugging, and administrative tasks.

## Connecting

<Steps>

    Go to the **Resources** tab in your PAM project, open the SSH resource, and find the account you want to access. Click the **Connect** button next to the account.

## Usage

Once connected, you have a full interactive shell.

## Authentication Methods

All three SSH [authentication methods](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources/ssh#authentication-methods) are supported:

- **Password** — username and password
- **SSH Key** — public/private key pair
- **Certificate** — SSH certificates

Credentials are injected automatically from the PAM account configuration. You never need to enter or see them.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Is this a real SSH session?">
        Yes. Unlike the PostgreSQL web access terminal which is a custom SQL REPL, the SSH terminal is a real SSH shell session proxied through the Infisical Gateway. You get a full interactive shell with all the capabilities of a native SSH connection.
