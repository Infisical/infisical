The PostgreSQL web access terminal provides a `psql`-like experience in your browser. It is designed for light, ad-hoc usage — quick queries, debugging, and administrative tasks — not as a replacement for a full database client or long-running workloads.

## Connecting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Account">
    Go to the **Resources** tab in your PAM project, open the PostgreSQL resource, and find the account you want to access. Click the **Connect** button next to the account.

    Alternatively, if you are on the account page, click the **Access** button.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect in Browser">
    In the connect modal, click **Connect in Browser** to open the web access terminal.

  </Step>

  <Step title="End Session">
    Click the **Disconnect** button from the web access terminal status bar or type `\q`, `quit`, or `exit`. You can reconnect from the same page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Once connected, you'll see a `=>` prompt. Type SQL queries as you would in `psql`:

```sql
=> SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;
 id | name       | email
----+------------+---------------------
  1 | Alice      | alice@example.com
  2 | Bob        | bob@example.com
(2 rows)
```

### Transactions

Transactions are fully supported. You can use `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` as you would in `psql`:

```sql
=> BEGIN;
BEGIN
=> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE 1
=> UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE 1
=> COMMIT;
COMMIT
```

## Limits

In addition to the [common session limits](/documentation/platform/pam/product-reference/web-access/overview#session-limits), the following PostgreSQL-specific limits apply:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Statement timeout** | 30 seconds per query |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Is this an actual psql session?">
        No. The web access terminal is not a `psql` client. It is a custom SQL REPL that connects directly to PostgreSQL and provides a `psql`-like experience, including familiar prompts and tabular output formatting. Backslash commands like `\dt` or `\d` are not supported.
