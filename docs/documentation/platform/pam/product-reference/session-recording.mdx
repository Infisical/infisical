Infisical PAM provides robust session recording capabilities to help you audit and monitor user activity across your infrastructure.

## How It Works

When a user initiates a session by accessing an account, a recording of the session begins. The Gateway securely caches all recording data in temporary encrypted files on its local system.

Once the session concludes, the gateway transmits the complete recording to the Infisical platform for long-term, centralized storage. This asynchronous process ensures that sessions remain operational even if the connection to the Infisical platform is temporarily lost. After the upload is complete, administrators can search and review the session logs on the Infisical platform.

## What's Captured

The content captured during a session depends on the type of resource being accessed.

## Viewing Recordings

To review session recordings:

1. Navigate to the **Sessions** page in your PAM project.
2. Click on a session from the list to view its details.

The session details page provides key information, including the complete session logs, connection status, the user who initiated it, and more.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Are session recordings encrypted?">
        Yes. All session recordings are encrypted at rest by default, ensuring your data is always secure.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why aren't recordings streamed in real-time?">
        Currently, Infisical uses an asynchronous approach where the gateway records the entire session locally before uploading it. This design makes your PAM sessions more resilient, as they don't depend on a constant, active connection to the Infisical platform. We may introduce live streaming capabilities in a future release.
