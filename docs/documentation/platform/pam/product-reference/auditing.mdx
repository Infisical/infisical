## What's Audited

Infisical logs a wide range of actions to provide a complete audit trail for your PAM project. These actions include:

- Session Start and End
- Fetching session credentials
- Creating, updating, or deleting resources, accounts, folders, and sessions

<Info>
    Please note: Audit logs track metadata about sessions (e.g., start/end times), but not the specific commands executed *within* them. For detailed in-session activity, check out [Session Recording](/documentation/platform/pam/product-reference/session-recording).
</Info>

## Viewing Audit Logs

You can view, search, and filter all events from the **Audit Logs** page within your PAM project.
