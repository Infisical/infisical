Infisical Privileged Access Management (PAM) provides a centralized way to manage and secure access to your critical infrastructure. It allows you to enforce fine-grained, policy-based controls over resources like databases, servers, and more, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, and only when they need to.

Infisical PAM organizes access around your resources (e.g., databases, servers, web apps). This resource-centric approach makes it intuitive to manage permissions and scale your security policies as your infrastructure grows.

## Core Capabilities

- **[Auditing](/documentation/platform/pam/product-reference/auditing)**: Track and review a comprehensive log of all user actions and system events.
- **[Session Recording](/documentation/platform/pam/product-reference/session-recording)**: Record and playback user sessions for security reviews, compliance, and troubleshooting.
- **[Automated Credential Rotation](/documentation/platform/pam/getting-started/resources#automated-credential-rotation)**: Automatically rotate credentials for supported resources to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
