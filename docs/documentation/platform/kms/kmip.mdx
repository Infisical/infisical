## Overview

Infisical KMS provides **Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)** support, enabling seamless integration with KMIP-compatible clients. This allows for enhanced key management across various applications that support the **KMIP 1.4 protocol**.

## Supported Operations

The Infisical KMIP server supports the following operations for **symmetric keys**:

- **Create** - Generate symmetric keys.
- **Register** - Register externally created keys.
- **Locate** - Find keys using attributes.
- **Get** - Retrieve keys securely.
- **Activate** - Enable keys for usage.
- **Revoke** - Revoke existing keys.
- **Destroy** - Permanently remove keys.
- **Get Attributes** - Retrieve metadata associated with keys.
- **Query** - Query server capabilities and supported operations.

## Benefits of KMIP Integration

Integrating Infisical KMS with KMIP-compatible clients provides the following benefits:

- **Standardized Key Management**: Allows interoperability with security and cryptographic applications that support KMIP.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Utilizes Infisical’s encryption mechanisms to securely store and manage keys.
- **Centralized Key Management**: Enables a unified approach for managing cryptographic keys across multiple environments.

## Compatibility

Infisical KMIP supports **KMIP versions 1.0 to 1.4**, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of clients and security tools.

## Secure Communication & Authorization

KMIP client-server communication is secured using **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, ensuring strong identity verification and encrypted data exchange via **PKI certificates**. Each KMIP entity must possess valid certificates signed by a trusted Root CA to establish trust.
For strong isolation, each Infisical organization has its own KMIP PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), ensuring that cryptographic operations and certificate authorities remain separate across organizations.

Infisical KMS enforces a **two-layer authorization model** for KMIP operations:

1. **KMIP Server Authorization** – The KMIP server, acting as a proxy, must have the `proxy KMIP` permission to forward client requests to Infisical KMS. This is done using a **machine identity** attached to the KMIP server.
2. **KMIP Client Authorization** – Clients must have the necessary KMIP-level permissions to perform specific key management operations.

By combining **mTLS for secure communication** and **machine identity-based proxying**, Infisical KMS ensures **strong authentication, controlled access, and centralized key management** for KMIP operations.

## Setup Instructions

### Setup KMIP for your organization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the organization settings > KMIP">
    From there, press Setup KMIP.
    ![KMIP org navigate](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-org-setup-navigation.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure KMIP PKI for the organization">
    In the modal, select the desired key algorithm to use for the KMIP PKI of your organization. Press continue.
    ![KMIP org PKI setup](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-org-setup-modal.png)

    This generates the KMIP PKI for your organization. After this, you can proceed to setting up your KMIP server.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deploying and Configuring the KMIP Server

Follow these steps to configure and deploy a KMIP server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Machine Identity">
    Configure a [machine identity](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities#machine-identities) for the KMIP server to use.
    ![KMIP create machine identity](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-create-mi.png)

    Create a custom organization role and give it the **Proxy KMIP** permission.
    ![KMIP create custom role](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-create-custom-role.png)
    ![KMIP assign proxy to role](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-assign-custom-role-proxy.png)

    Assign the machine identity to the custom organization role. This allows the machine identity to serve KMIP client requests and forward them from your KMIP server to Infisical.
    ![KMIP assign role to machine identity](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-assign-mi-to-role.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start up the KMIP server">
    To deploy the KMIP server, use the Infisical CLI’s `kmip start` command.  
    Before proceeding, make sure you have the [Infisical CLI installed](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview).

    Once installed, launch the KMIP server with the following command:

    ```bash
    infisical kmip start \
      --identity-client-id=<machine-identity-client-id> \ # This can be set by defining the INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID ENV variable
      --identity-client-secret=<machine-identity-client-secret> \ # This can be set by defining the INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET ENV variable
      --domain=https://app.infisical.com \
      --hostnames-or-ips="my-kmip-server.com"
    ```

    The following flags are available for the `infisical kmip start` command::
    - **listen-address** (default: localhost:5696): The address the KMIP server listens on.
    - **identity-auth-method** (default: universal-auth): The authentication method for the machine identity.
    - **identity-client-id**:  The client ID of the machine identity. This can be set by defining the `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` ENV variable.
    - **identity-client-secret**: The client secret of the machine identity. This can be set by defining the `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` ENV variable.
    - **server-name** (default: "kmip-server"): The name of the KMIP server.
    - **certificate-ttl** (default: "1y"): The duration for which the server certificate is valid.
    - **hostnames-or-ips:** A comma-separated list of hostnames or IPs the KMIP server will use (required).

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add and Configure KMIP Clients

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the desired KMS project and select KMIP">
    From there, press Add KMIP Client
    ![KMIP client overview](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-client-overview.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure KMIP client">
    In the modal, provide the details of your client. The selected permissions determine what KMIP operations can be performed in your KMS project.
    ![KMIP client modal](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-client-modal.png)
  </Step>
    <Step title="Generate client certificate">
    Once the KMIP client is created, you will have to generate a client certificate.
    Press Generate Certificate.
    ![KMIP generate client cert](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-client-generate-cert.png)

    Provide the desired TTL and key algorithm to use and press Generate Client Certificate.
    ![KMIP client cert config](/images/platform/kms/kmip/kmip-client-cert-config-modal.png)

    Configure your KMIP clients to use the generated client certificate, certificate chain and private key.
