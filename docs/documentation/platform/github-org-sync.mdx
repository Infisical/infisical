## Overview

The GitHub Organization Synchronization feature streamlines user and group management by automatically syncing users belonging to your specified GitHub organization with corresponding groups within Infisical. This integration ensures that users logging in via GitHub are automatically added to or removed from Infisical groups based on their team memberships within your GitHub organization.

## Configuration

To enable and configure GitHub Organization Synchronization, follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up GitHub organization configuration">
        1. Navigate to the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** page and select the **Provisioning** tab.
        ![config](../../images/platform/external-syncs/github-org-sync-section.png)
        2. Click the **Configure** button and provide the name of your GitHub Organization.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Approve the Infisical OAuth application on your organization">
        Connecting the Infisical OAuth application grants it permission to **read:org** details. This approval is done by selecting your organization during the GitHub OAuth login process.

        1. Initiate the login process via the GitHub OAuth flow.

        2. Select the organization you have connected.

        <Info>

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Working

Once configured, the GitHub Organization Synchronization feature functions as follows:

When a user logs in via the GitHub OAuth flow and selects the configured organization, the system will then automatically synchronize the teams they are a part of in GitHub with corresponding groups in Infisical.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Please check if your organization has approved the Infisical OAuth application.">
    If you encounter an error related to this, it indicates that you need to approve the Infisical OAuth application within your GitHub organization.

    You can verify the application's approval status by navigating to **https://github.com/organizations/__your-organization__/settings/oauth_application_policy**. Replace `__your-organization__` with the actual name of your GitHub organization.
