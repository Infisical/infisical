In certain situations, developers need to expand their access to a certain new project or a sensitive environment. For those use cases, it is helpful to utilize Infisical's **Access Requests** functionality. 

This functionality works in the following way: 
1. A project administrator sets up an access policy that assigns access managers (also known as eligible approvers) to a certain sensitive folder or environment.

2. When a developer requests access to one of such sensitive resources, the request is visible in the dashboard, and the corresponding eligible approvers get an email notification about it.

4. An eligible approver can approve or reject the access request.

<Info>
 If the access request matches with a policy that has a **Soft** enforcement level, the requester may bypass the policy and get access to the resource without full approval.

5. As soon as the request is approved, developer is able to access the sought resources.
