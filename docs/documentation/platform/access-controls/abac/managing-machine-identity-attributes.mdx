Machine identities can have metadata set manually, just like users. In addition, during the machine authentication process (e.g., via OIDC), extra attributes called claimsâ€”are provided, which can be used in your ABAC policies.

#### Accessing Attributes From Machine Identity Login

When machine identities authenticate, they may receive additional payloads/attributes from the service provider.
For methods like OIDC, these come as claims in the token and can be made available in your policies.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OIDC Login Attributes">
    1. Navigate to the Identity Authentication settings and select the OIDC Auth Method.
    2. In the **Advanced section**, locate the Claim Mapping configuration.
    3. Map the OIDC claims to permission attributes by specifying:
       - **Attribute Name:** The identifier to be used in your policies (e.g., department).
       - **Claim Path:** The dot notation path to the claim in the OIDC token (e.g., user.department).

    For example, if your OIDC provider returns:

    ```json
    {
      "sub": "machine456",
      "name": "Service A",
      "user": {
        "department": "engineering",
        "role": "service"
      }
    }
    ```

    You might map:

    - **department:** to `user.department`
    - **role:** to `user.role`

    Once configured, these attributes become available in your policies using the following format:

    ```
    {{ identity.auth.oidc.claims.<permission claim name> }}
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Kubernetes Login Attributes">
		For identities authenticated using Kubernetes, the service account's namespace and name are available in their policy and can be accessed as follows:

    ```
    {{ identity.auth.kubernetes.namespace }}
    {{ identity.auth.kubernetes.name }}
    ```

    <img src="/images/platform/access-controls/abac-policy-k8s-format.png" />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="AWS Attributes">
    For identities authenticated using AWS Auth, several attributes can be accessed. On top of the 3 base attributes, there's 4 derived from the ARN. The example below includes comments showing how each derived attribute looks like based on this ARN: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/example-user`

    ```
    {{ identity.auth.aws.accountId }}
    {{ identity.auth.aws.arn }}
    {{ identity.auth.aws.userId }}

    // Derived from ARN
    {{ identity.auth.aws.partition }} // aws
    {{ identity.auth.aws.service }} // iam
    {{ identity.auth.aws.resourceType }} // user
    {{ identity.auth.aws.resourceName }} // example-user
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other Authentication Method Attributes">
    At the moment we only support OIDC claims, Kubernetes attributes, and AWS attributes. Payloads on other authentication methods are not yet accessible.
