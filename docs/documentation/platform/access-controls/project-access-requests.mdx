Infisical supports two primary ways users can access projects:

* **By Membership**: Users are explicitly added to a project. 
* **By Permission**: Users with the `Access all organization projects` permission can view and manage all projects in the organization, even those they are not a member of.

Users who do not have access to a project (and lack the above permission) can request access through the dashboard.

# Viewing Projects

From the Infisical dashboard, users can explore projects across the organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in and go to the main dashboard" />
  <Step title="Switch between project views using the tabs">
    - **My Projects**: Projects you’re a member of  
    - **All Projects**: All projects within the organization

  </Step>
</Steps>

# Requesting Access to a Project

If you are not a member of a project and lack global access permissions, you can request access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Request Access button next to the desired project">
    ![request-access](/images/platform/project-access-requests/request-access.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a comment explaining your reason for access (optional)">
    ![access-comment](/images/platform/project-access-requests/access-comment.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Submit Request" />
</Steps>

<Info>
  Project administrators will be notified via email and can approve or reject the request.

# Gaining Access with Admin Permissions

Users with the `Access all organization projects` permission (an organization level permission), typically Organization Admins, can directly gain access to any project, bypassing the request workflow. 
This is intended for break-glass scenarios, such as when a project has no active admin or support is required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Gain Access button next to the project">
    ![gain-access](/images/platform/project-access-requests/gain-access.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type access to confirm your action">
    ![gain-access-conf](/images/platform/project-access-requests/gain-access-conf.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Submit Request" />
</Steps>

<Info>
  Gaining access this way grants full Project Admin privileges.
