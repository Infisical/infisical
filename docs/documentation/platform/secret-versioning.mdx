Every time a secret change is performed, a new version of the same secret is created. 

Such versions can be accessed visually by opening up the [secret sidebar](/documentation/platform/project#drawer) (as seen below) or [retrieved via API](/api-reference/endpoints/secrets/read) 
by specifying the `version` query parameter.

The secret versioning functionality is heavily connected to [Point-in-time Recovery](/documentation/platform/pit-recovery) of secrets in Infisical.

<Note>
  You can copy and paste a secret version value to the "Value" input field "roll
  back" to that secret version. This creates a new secret version at the top of
  the stack. We're releasing the ability to automatically roll back to
  a secret version soon.
