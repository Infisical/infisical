**LDAP Auth** is an LDAP based authentication method that allows you to authenticate with Infisical using a machine identity configured with an [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) directory.

## Templates

You can create reusable LDAP authentication templates to standardize configurations across multiple machine identities. Templates help ensure consistency, reduce configuration errors, and simplify identity management at scale.

To create and manage LDAP auth templates, see our [Machine Identity Auth Templates documentation](/documentation/platform/identities/auth-templates). Once you've created a template, you can apply it when configuring LDAP auth for your identities in the guide below.

## Guide
<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating an identity">
    To create an identity, head to your Organization Settings > Access Control > Identities and press **Create identity**.

    ![Create identity](/images/platform/identities/ldap/identities-org-create-identity.png)

    When creating an identity, you specify an organization level role for it to assume; you can configure roles in Organization Settings > Access Control > Organization Roles.

    ![Create identity modal](/images/platform/identities/ldap/identities-org-create-identity-modal.png)

    Now input a few details for your new identity. Here's some guidance for each field:

    - Name (required): A friendly name for the identity.
    - Role (required): A role from the Organization Roles tab for the identity to assume. The organization role assigned will determine what organization level resources this identity can have access to.

    Once you've created an identity, you'll be redirected to a page where you can manage the identity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring LDAP auth for your identity">
    To configure LDAP auth for your identity, press the **Add Auth Method** button on the identity's page.

    ![Add auth method](/images/platform/identities/ldap/identities-org-add-auth-method.png)
    
    Now select **LDAP Auth** from the list of available auth methods for the identity.

    ![Select LDAP auth](/images/platform/identities/ldap/identities-org-add-auth-method-modal.png)
    
    
    After selecting **LDAP Auth**, you'll see the form you need to fill out to configure LDAP auth for your identity. The following fields are available:

    - `URL`: The LDAP server to connect to such as `ldap://ldap.your-org.com`, `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636` _(for connection over SSL/TLS)_, etc.
    - `Bind DN`: The DN to bind to the LDAP server with.
    - `Bind Pass`: The password to bind to the LDAP server with.
    - `Search Base / DN`: Base DN under which to perform user search such as `ou=Users,dc=acme,dc=com`.
    - `User Search Filter`: Template used to construct the LDAP user search filter such as `(uid={{username}})`; use literal `{{username}}` to have the given username used in the search. The default is `(uid={{username}})` which is compatible with several common directory schemas.
    - `Required Attributes`: A key/value pair of attributes that must be present in the LDAP user entry for them to be authenticated. As an example, if you set key `uid` to value `user1,user2,user3`, then only users with `uid` of `user1`, `user2`, or `user3` will be able to login with this identity. Each value is a comma separated list of attributes.
    - `CA Certificate`: The CA certificate to use when verifying the LDAP server certificate. This field is optional but recommended.
    - `Access Token TTL` _(default is 2592000 equivalent to 30 days)_: The lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time.
    - `Access Token Max TTL` _(default is 2592000 equivalent to 30 days)_: The maximum lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time.
    - `Access Token Max Number of Uses` _(default is 0)_: The maximum number of times that an access token can be used; a value of 0 implies infinite number of uses.
    - `Access Token Trusted IPs`: The IPs or CIDR ranges that access tokens can be used from. By default, each token is given the 0.0.0.0/0, allowing usage from any network address.

    Once you've filled out the form, press **Add** to save your changes.

    <Step title="Authenticating with the identity">
      After configuring LDAP auth for your identity, you can authenticate with the identity and obtain an access token using your LDAP credentials.

      ```bash
        curl --request POST \
          --url https://app.infisical.com/api/v1/auth/ldap-auth/login \
          --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          --data '{
          "identityId": "<string>",
          "username": "<string>",
          "password": "<string>"
        }'
      ```

      <Note>
        For EU Cloud and Self-Hosted users, make sure to replace `https://app.infisical.com` with `https://eu.infisical.com` or your self-hosted instance's URL in the request URL.
      </Note>

      If successful, you'll receive an access token in the response body.

      ```json
      {
        "accessToken": "your-access-token",
        "expiresIn": 2592000,
        "accessTokenMaxTTL": 2592000,
        "tokenType": "Bearer"
      }
      ```
