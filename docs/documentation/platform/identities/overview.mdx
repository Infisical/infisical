To interact with secrets and resource with Infisical, it is important to understand the concept of identities. 
Identities can be of two types: 
- **People** (e.g., developers, platform engineers, administrators)
- **Machines** (e.g., machine entities for managing secrets in CI/CD pipelines, production applications, and more)

Both people and machines are able to utilize corresponding clients (e.g., Dashboard UI, CLI, SDKs, API, Kubernetes Operator) together with allowed authentication methods (e.g., email & password, SAML SSO, LDAP, OIDC, Universal Auth).

## Calculating Identity Counts

Understanding how to calculate your identity requirements helps with capacity planning and licensing.

### User Identities

User identity count is straightforward—it equals the number of human users who need access to Infisical. This includes developers, DevOps/platform engineers, security administrators, and any other team members requiring direct Infisical access.

<Tip>
  User identities map 1:1 with people. If you have 50 engineers who need Infisical access, that's 50 user identities.
</Tip>

### Machine Identities

If you're familiar with cloud provider IAM concepts, Infisical machine identities work the same way:

| Cloud Provider | Equivalent Concept |
|----------------|-------------------|
| AWS | IAM Roles |
| GCP | Service Accounts |
| Azure | Service Principals |
| Kubernetes | ServiceAccounts |

Just as you don't create a new IAM role for every EC2 instance or a new service account for every VM, you don't create a new Infisical machine identity for every machine. Instead, machine identities are **permission-based, not machine-based**—they represent a unique set of access permissions that can be shared across multiple workloads.

<Info>
  **Key principle**: If multiple machines require identical permissions to the same secrets, they share a single machine identity—just like multiple EC2 instances can assume the same IAM role.
</Info>

#### How to Calculate Machine Identities

Consider these factors when determining your machine identity count:

| Factor | Impact on Identity Count |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Unique permission sets** | Each distinct combination of project access + environment access + secret paths = 1 identity |
| **Number of machines** | Does NOT directly increase identity count if permissions are identical |
| **Authentication methods** | A single identity can authenticate via multiple methods (AWS IAM, Kubernetes, GCP, Azure, etc.) simultaneously |

#### Examples

<Accordion title="Example 1: Multiple VMs with identical access">
  **Scenario**: 10 VMs in your production environment all need read access to the same database credentials in `prod/database/*`.
  
  **Machine identities needed**: **1**
  
  All VMs share the same permission requirements, so they authenticate using a single machine identity. This is equivalent to having 10 EC2 instances assume the same IAM role.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 2: Separate environments">
  **Scenario**: You have application servers for staging and production, each needing access to their respective environment's secrets.
  
  **Machine identities needed**: **2**
  
  - 1 identity for staging servers → access to `staging/*`
  - 1 identity for production servers → access to `prod/*`
  
  Even if you have 20 staging servers and 50 production servers, you only need 2 identities—just as you'd have separate IAM roles for staging vs. production access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 3: CI/CD pipelines with different scopes">
  **Scenario**: Your CI/CD system has:
  - Build pipelines that need read access to artifact registry credentials
  - Deployment pipelines that need read access to cloud provider secrets and database URLs
  - Security scanning pipelines that need access to scanning tool API keys
  
  **Machine identities needed**: **3**
  
  Each pipeline type has distinct permission requirements, warranting separate identities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 4: Multi-cloud authentication">
  **Scenario**: Your application runs across AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and Azure AKS, but all clusters need identical access to the same secrets.
  
  **Machine identities needed**: **1**
  
  A single machine identity can have multiple authentication methods configured simultaneously. You would attach AWS IAM Auth, GCP IAM Auth, and Azure Auth to the same identity, allowing workloads from any cloud to authenticate to the same permission set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example 5: Microservices architecture">
  **Scenario**: You have 15 microservices:
  - 10 services need access only to shared infrastructure secrets (Redis, message queue)
  - 3 services need access to payment processing secrets
  - 2 services need access to third-party integration API keys
  
  **Machine identities needed**: **3**
  
  Group services by their secret access requirements, not by the number of service instances or replicas.
</Accordion>

#### Quick Assessment Questions

When planning your machine identity requirements, ask:

1. **What distinct secret access patterns exist?** Group workloads by the secrets they need, not by their deployment location or replica count.

2. **Which workloads can share permissions?** Workloads accessing identical secrets with identical permissions should use the same identity—just as you'd assign the same IAM role to resources with identical access needs.

3. **What's my authentication topology?** A single identity can authenticate from multiple sources simultaneously (Kubernetes + AWS IAM + GCP + Azure), so multi-cloud deployments don't necessarily mean multiple identities.

<Note>
  **Best practice**: Start with fewer, broader identities and create additional identities only when you need to enforce distinct access boundaries. This simplifies management while maintaining security through least-privilege principles within each identity's scope.
