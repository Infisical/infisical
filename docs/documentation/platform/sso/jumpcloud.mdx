<Info>
   JumpCloud SAML SSO feature is a paid feature.
   
   If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Pro Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
   then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

1. In Infisical, head over to your organization Settings > Authentication > SAML SSO Configuration and select **Set up SAML SSO**.

<Note>
  When pasting the certificate into Infisical, you'll want to retain `-----BEGIN
  CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` at the first and last line
  of the text area respectively.
</Note>

10. Assignments

Back in JumpCloud, navigate to the **User Groups** tab and assign users to the newly created application.

11. Return to Infisical and enable SAML SSO.

Enabling SAML SSO enforces all members in your organization to only be able to log into Infisical via JumpCloud.

<Note>
   If you're configuring SAML SSO on a self-hosted instance of Infisical, make sure to
   set the `JWT_PROVIDER_AUTH_SECRET` and `SITE_URL` environment variable for it to work:
   
   - `JWT_PROVIDER_AUTH_SECRET`: This is secret key used for signing and verifying JWT. This could be a randomly-generated 256-bit hex string.
   - `SITE_URL`: The URL of your self-hosted instance of Infisical - should be an absolute URL including the protocol (e.g. https://app.infisical.com)
