---

You can have Infisical automatically sync group
memberships between Keycloak and Infisical by configuring a group membership mapper in Keycloak.
When a user logs in via OIDC, they will be added to Infisical groups that match their Keycloak groups names, and removed from any
Infisical groups not present in their groups claim.

<Info>
    When enabled, manual
    management of Infisical group memberships will be disabled.
</Info>

<Warning>
    Group membership changes in the Keycloak only sync with Infisical when a
    user logs in via OIDC. For example, if you remove a user from a group in Keycloak, this change will not be reflected in Infisical until their next OIDC login. To ensure this behavior, Infisical recommends enabling Enforce OIDC
    SSO in the OIDC settings.

    <Step title="Setup groups in Infisical and enable OIDC Group Membership Mapping">
        2.1. In Infisical, create any groups you would like to sync users to. Make sure the name of the Infisical group is an exact match of the Keycloak group name.
