<Info>
    Keycloak OIDC SSO is a paid feature. If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it
    is available under the **Pro Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical, then
    you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase a self-hosted license to
    use it.
</Info>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an OIDC client application in Keycloak">
        1.1. In your realm, navigate to the **Clients** tab and click **Create client** to create a new client application.

        <Info>
            You don’t typically need to make a realm dedicated to Infisical. We recommend adding Infisical as a client to your primary realm.
        </Info>

        1.2. In the General Settings step, set **Client type** to **OpenID Connect**, the **Client ID** field to an appropriate identifier, and the **Name** field to a friendly name like **Infisical**.

        1.3. Next, in the Capability Config step, ensure that **Client Authentication** is set to On and that **Standard flow** is enabled in the Authentication flow section.

        1.4. In the Login Settings step, set the following values:
        - Root URL: `https://app.infisical.com`.
        - Home URL: `https://app.infisical.com`.
        - Valid Redirect URIs: `https://app.infisical.com/api/v1/sso/oidc/callback`.
        - Web origins: `https://app.infisical.com`.

        ![OIDC keycloak create client login settings](/images/sso/keycloak-oidc/create-client-login-settings.png)
        <Info>
            If you’re self-hosting Infisical, then you will want to replace https://app.infisical.com (base URL) with your own domain.
        </Info>

        1.5. Next, navigate to the **Client scopes** tab and select the client's dedicated scope.

        1.7. Select the **email**, **given name**, **family name** attributes and click **Add**.

        ![OIDC keycloak client mappers predefined 2](/images/sso/keycloak-oidc/scope-predefined-mapper-2.png)

        Once you've completed the above steps, the list of mappers should look like the following:

    </Step>
    <Step title="Retrieve Identity Provider (IdP) Information from Keycloak">
        2.1. Back in Keycloak, navigate to Configure > Realm settings > General tab > Endpoints > OpenID Endpoint Configuration and copy the opened URL. This is what is to referred to as the Discovery Document URL and it takes the form: `https://keycloak-mysite.com/realms/myrealm/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
        ![OIDC keycloak realm OIDC metadata](/images/sso/keycloak-oidc/realm-setting-oidc-config.png)

        2.2. From the Clients page, navigate to the Credential tab and copy the **Client Secret** to be used in the next steps.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Finish configuring OIDC in Infisical">
        3.1. Back in Infisical, head to the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** page and select the **General** tab. Click **Connect** for **OIDC**.
        ![OIDC SSO Connect](../../../../images/sso/connect-oidc.png)

        3.2. For configuration type, select Discovery URL. Then, set the appropriate values for **Discovery Document URL**, **JWT Signature Algorithm**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.
        ![OIDC keycloak paste values into Infisical](/images/sso/keycloak-oidc/create-oidc.png)

        <Info>
            Currently, the following JWT signature algorithms are supported: RS256, RS512, HS256, and EdDSA
        </Info>

        Once you've done that, press **Update** to complete the required configuration.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable OIDC SSO in Infisical">
        Enabling OIDC SSO allows members in your organization to log into Infisical via Keycloak.

        ![OIDC keycloak enable OIDC](/images/sso/enable-oidc.png)

    </Step>
    <Step title="Enforce OIDC SSO in Infisical">
        Enforcing OIDC SSO ensures that members in your organization can only access Infisical
        by logging into the organization via Keycloak.

        To enforce OIDC SSO, you're required to test out the OpenID connection by successfully authenticating at least one Keycloak user with Infisical.
        Once you've completed this requirement, you can toggle the **Enforce OIDC SSO** button to enforce OIDC SSO.

        <Warning>
            We recommend ensuring that your account is provisioned using the application in Keycloak
            prior to enforcing OIDC SSO to prevent any unintended issues.
        </Warning>
        <Info>
            In case of a lockout, an organization admin can use the [Admin Login Portal](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/sso/overview#admin-login-portal) in the `/login/admin` path e.g. https://app.infisical.com/login/admin.
        </Info>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
    If you are only using one organization on your Infisical instance, you can configure a default organization in the [Server Admin Console](/documentation/platform/admin-panel/server-admin#default-organization) to expedite OIDC login.
</Tip>

<Note>
    If you're configuring OIDC SSO on a self-hosted instance of Infisical, make
    sure to set the `AUTH_SECRET` and `SITE_URL` environment variable for it to
    work:
    <div class="height:1px;"/>
    - `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JWT. This
    can be a random 32-byte base64 string generated with `openssl rand -base64
    32`.
    <div class="height:1px;"/>
    - `SITE_URL`: The absolute URL of your self-hosted instance of Infisical including the protocol (e.g. https://app.infisical.com)
