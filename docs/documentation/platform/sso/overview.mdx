<Info>
  Infisical offers Google SSO and GitHub SSO for free across both Infisical
  Cloud and Infisical Self-hosted. Infisical also offers SAML SSO authentication
  and OpenID Connect (OIDC) but as paid features that can be unlocked on
  Infisical Cloud's **Pro** tier or via enterprise license on self-hosted
  instances of Infisical. On this front, we support industry-leading providers
  including Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud; with any questions, please reach out
  to team@infisical.com.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) or [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does Infisical require additional email verification for users connected via SAML?">
    By default, Infisical Cloud is configured to not trust emails from external
    identity providers to prevent any malicious account takeover attempts via
    email spoofing. Accordingly, Infisical creates a new user for anyone provisioned
    through an external identity provider and requires an additional email
    verification step upon their first login.

    If you're running a self-hosted instance of Infisical and would like it to trust emails from external identity providers,
    you can configure this behavior in the admin panel.
