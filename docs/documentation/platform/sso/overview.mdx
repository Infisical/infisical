<Warning>
  Infisical currently only supports SAML SSO authentication with Okta and Azure
  AD. We're expanding support for other IdPs in the coming months, so stay tuned
  with this issue [here](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues/442).
</Warning>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

To note, configuring SSO retains the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps. In all login with SSO implementations,
your IdP cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
