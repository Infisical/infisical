<Warning>
  Infisical offers Google SSO and GitHub SSO for free across both Infisical Cloud and Infisical Self-hosted.
  
  Infisical also offers SAML SSO authentication but as paid features that can be unlocked on Infisical Cloud's **Pro** tier
  or via enterprise license on self-hosted instances of Infisical. On this front, we support industry-leading providers including 
  Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud; with any questions, please reach out to [sales@infisical.com](mailto:sales@infisical.com).
</Warning>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

To note, configuring SSO retains the end-to-end encrypted architecture of Infisical because we decouple the **authentication** and **decryption** steps. In all login with SSO implementations,
your IdP cannot and will not have access to the decryption key needed to decrypt your secrets.
