Using GitLab SSO on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an OAuth application in GitLab and registering your instance with it.

## Create an OAuth application in GitLab

Navigate to your user Settings > Applications to create a new GitLab application.

![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/edit-profile.png) 
![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/new-app.png) 

Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/sso/gitlab`.
Note that only `read_user` is required as part of the **Scopes** configuration.

<Note>
    If you have a GitLab group, you can create an OAuth application under it
    in your group Settings > Applications.
</Note>

## Add your OAuth application credentials to Infisical

Obtain the **Application ID** and **Secret** for your GitLab application.

Back in your Infisical instance, make sure to set the following environment variables:

- `CLIENT_ID_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The **Client ID** of your GitLab application.
- `CLIENT_SECRET_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The **Secret** of your GitLab application.
- (optional) `URL_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The URL of your self-hosted instance of GitLab where the OAuth application is registered. If no URL is passed in, this will default to `https://gitlab.com`.
- `JWT_PROVIDER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JWT. This could be a randomly-generated 256-bit hex string.
- `SITE_URL`: The URL of your self-hosted instance of Infisical - should be an absolute URL including the protocol (e.g. https://app.infisical.com)
   
Once added, restart your Infisical instance and log in with GitLab.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is GitLab SSO not working?">
    It is likely that you have misconfigured your self-hosted instance of Infisical. You should:

    - Check that you have set the `CLIENT_ID_GITLAB_LOGIN`, `CLIENT_SECRET_GITLAB_LOGIN`, 
    `JWT_PROVIDER_AUTH_SECRET`, and `SITE_URL` environment variables.
    - Check that the **Redirect URI** specified in GitLab matches the `SITE_URL` environment variable.
    For example, if the former is `https://app.infisical.com/api/v1/sso/gitlab` then the latter should be `https://app.infisical.com`.
