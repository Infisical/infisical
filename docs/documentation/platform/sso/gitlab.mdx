Using GitLab SSO on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an OAuth application in GitLab and registering your instance with it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an OAuth application in GitLab">
    Navigate to your user Settings > Applications to create a new GitLab application.

    ![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/edit-profile.png) 
    ![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/new-app.png) 

    Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/sso/gitlab`.
    Note that only `read_user` is required as part of the **Scopes** configuration.

    ![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/new-app-form.png) 

    <Note>
        If you have a GitLab group, you can create an OAuth application under it
        in your group Settings > Applications.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your OAuth application credentials to Infisical">
    Obtain the **Application ID** and **Secret** for your GitLab application.

    ![sso gitlab config](/images/sso/gitlab/credentials.png) 

    Back in your Infisical instance, make sure to set the following environment variables:

    - `CLIENT_ID_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The **Client ID** of your GitLab application.
    - `CLIENT_SECRET_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The **Secret** of your GitLab application.
    - (optional) `URL_GITLAB_LOGIN`: The URL of your self-hosted instance of GitLab where the OAuth application is registered. If no URL is passed in, this will default to `https://gitlab.com`.
    - `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JWT. This can be a random 32-byte base64 string generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    - `SITE_URL`: The URL of your self-hosted instance of Infisical - should be an absolute URL including the protocol (e.g. https://app.infisical.com)
      
    Once added, restart your Infisical instance and log in with GitLab.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is GitLab SSO not working?">
    It is likely that you have misconfigured your self-hosted instance of Infisical. You should:

    - Check that you have set the `CLIENT_ID_GITLAB_LOGIN`, `CLIENT_SECRET_GITLAB_LOGIN`, 
    `AUTH_SECRET`, and `SITE_URL` environment variables.
    - Check that the **Redirect URI** specified in GitLab matches the `SITE_URL` environment variable.
    For example, if the former is `https://app.infisical.com/api/v1/sso/gitlab` then the latter should be `https://app.infisical.com`.
