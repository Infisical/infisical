Developers frequently need to share secrets with team members, contractors, or other third parties, which can be risky due to potential leaks or misuse.
Infisical offers a secure solution for sharing secrets over the internet in a time and view-count bound manner. It is possible to share secrets without signing up via [share.infisical.com](https://share.infisical.com) or via Infisical Dashboard (which has more advanced functionality).
