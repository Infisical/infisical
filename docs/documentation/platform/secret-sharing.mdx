Developers frequently need to share secrets with team members, contractors, or other third parties, which can be risky due to potential leaks or misuse.
Infisical offers a secure solution for sharing secrets over the internet in a time and view-count bound manner. It is possible to share secrets without signing up via [share.infisical.com](https://share.infisical.com) or via Infisical Dashboard (which has more advanced functionality).

## Custom Branding

<Info>
    Custom branding for shared secret pages is a paid feature.

    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical, then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

You can customize the branding of your shared secret pages and secret request pages by providing your own logo and colors.

![Custom Branding Settings](../../images/platform/secret-sharing/custom-branding-settings.png)

If custom branding is added, the shared secret page will display your custom logo and colors without any information about Infisical.
