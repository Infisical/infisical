<Info>
    LDAP is a paid feature.

If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
then you should contact sales@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

</Info>

You can configure your organization in Infisical to have members authenticate with the platform via [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol).

LDAP providers:

- Active Directory
- [JumpCloud LDAP](/documentation/platform/ldap/jumpcloud)
- AWS Directory Service
- Foxpass

Read the general instructions for configuring LDAP [here](/documentation/platform/ldap/general).

If the documentation for your required identity provider is not shown in the list above, please reach out to [team@infisical.com](mailto:team@infisical.com) for assistance.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does Infisical require additional email verification for users connected via LDAP?">
    By default, Infisical Cloud is configured to not trust emails from external
    identity providers to prevent any malicious account takeover attempts via
    email spoofing. Accordingly, Infisical creates a new user for anyone provisioned
    through an external identity provider and requires an additional email
    verification step upon their first login.

    If you're running a self-hosted instance of Infisical and would like it to trust emails from external identity providers,
    you can configure this behavior in the admin panel.
