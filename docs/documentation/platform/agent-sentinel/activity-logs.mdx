## Concept

Activity Logs provide complete visibility into how AI agents are using tools through your MCP endpoints. Every tool invocation is logged with detailed information including timestamps, the endpoint used, which tool was called, who initiated the request, and the full request/response payloads.

## What Gets Logged

Every tool invocation through an MCP endpoint creates a log entry containing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When the tool was invoked |
| **Endpoint** | The MCP endpoint used |
| **Tool** | The name of the tool that was called |
| **User** | The user who initiated the request |
| **Request** | The full request payload sent to the tool |
| **Response** | The full response returned by the tool |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I export activity logs?">
    Yes, activity logs can be exported for external analysis or long-term storage. Enterprise plans include log streaming to external SIEM systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are sensitive data in requests/responses masked?">
    Infisical supports PII filtering to automatically detect and mask sensitive data in request and response payloads. When enabled on an MCP endpoint, the following PII types can be redacted:

    - **Email addresses** → `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`
    - **Phone numbers** → `[REDACTED_PHONE]`
    - **Social Security Numbers** → `[REDACTED_SSN]`
    - **Credit card numbers** → `[REDACTED_CREDIT_CARD]`
    - **IP addresses** → `[REDACTED_IP]`

    You can configure PII filtering separately for requests and responses, and select which PII types to detect. See [MCP Endpoints - PII Filtering](/documentation/platform/agent-sentinel/mcp-endpoints#pii-filtering) for configuration details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do failed tool invocations get logged?">
    Yes, all tool invocations are logged regardless of success or failure. Failed invocations include error details in the response payload.
