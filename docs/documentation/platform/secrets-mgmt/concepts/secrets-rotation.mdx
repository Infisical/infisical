## What is Secrets Rotation?

Secrets rotation is the process of regularly replacing credentials like API keys, database passwords, and tokens to reduce the risk of long-term exposure. Even if a secret is compromised, frequent rotation limits how long it can be used.

Without rotation, secrets often go unchanged for months or years â€” hardcoded in codebases, embedded in CI pipelines, or shared across environments. Over time, this increases the risk of leaks, misuse, and operational blind spots.

## Secrets Rotation in Infisical

Infisical automates rotation using a rolling lifecycle model where new credentials are issued on a fixed schedule with previous ones remaining temporarily valid to give systems time to update without disruption. Each secret moves through three phases: active, inactive, and eventually revoked. This ensures that applications continue to function smoothly throughout the rotation process.

When rotation is applicable for a given secret type, using it is strongly recommended. Infisical supports configuring automatic rotation for a growing set of use cases including [PostgreSQL](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/postgres-credentials), [MySQL](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/mysql-credentials), [Microsoft SQL Server](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/mssql-credentials), [OracleDB](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/oracledb-credentials), [LDAP](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/ldap-password), [AWS IAM users](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam-user-secret), [Azure](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/azure-client-secret) and [Okta](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/okta-client-secret) client secrets, and more.
