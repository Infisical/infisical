description: "Learn how to deliver secrets from Infisical into the systems, applications, and environments that need them."
---

Once secrets are stored and scoped in Infisical, the next step is delivering them securely to the systems and applications that need them.

Infisical supports many delivery methods to match a wide range of environments — from [local development](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-delivery#local-development%2C-scripts%2C-and-one-off-tasks) to [Kubernetes workloads](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-delivery#kubernetes-workloads), [CI/CD pipelines](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-delivery#ci%2Fcd-pipelines), [infrastructure-as-code tools](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-delivery#infrastructure-as-code-and-automation-tools), and more.

The table below provides a quick overview of which delivery method may be suitable to use based on your environment and how secrets are consumed:

From here, you can explore the delivery method that best matches your environment:

## Local Development, Scripts, and One-Off Tasks

For local development, one-off scripts, or basic automation, the [Infisical CLI](/cli/overview) is a quick and flexible option.

Instead of using a `.env` file, you can use [`infisical run`](/cli/commands/run) to inject secrets as environment variables directly into your development process. This provides a cleaner and more secure workflow. You can also use [`infisical secrets`](/cli/commands/secrets#infisical-secrets) to perform CRUD operations on secrets from the command line, which works well for debugging, local tooling, and lightweight scripting.

To learn more, refer to the [CLI quickstart](cli/usage).

## Applications and Services

When secrets need to be accessed directly from within application code, Infisical provides SDKs for [Node.js](https://github.com/Infisical/node-sdk-v2), [Python](https://github.com/Infisical/python-sdk-official), [Go](/sdks/languages/go), [Java](https://github.com/Infisical/java-sdk), [.NET](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-dotnet-sdk), [C++](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-cpp-sdk), [Rust](https://github.com/Infisical/rust-sdk), and [Ruby](/sdks/languages/ruby).

These SDKs let services fetch secrets at runtime or startup. For unsupported languages or if you prefer direct integration, you can use the fully documented [HTTP API](/api-reference/overview/introduction) to fetch secrets within your application logic.

This approach gives you fine-grained control but also requires managing authentication and caching.

## Virtual Machines(VMs), Containers, and CI Environments

For systems that shouldn’t fetch secrets themselves — such as production VMs, Docker containers, or CI jobs — the [Infisical Agent](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent) can be used to sync secrets into the local environment on their behalf.

The agent runs as a lightweight background process and supports injecting secrets into files, environment variables, or application config formats. It's especially useful for non-interactive workloads that expect secrets to already exist at runtime.

You can run the agent as a standalone binary, as a Docker sidecar, or embedded in automation scripts. It works well in environments like:

- VMs that need secrets provisioned at startup.
- [Docker Swarm](/integrations/platforms/docker-swarm-with-agent) services using shared volumes.
- [ECS tasks](/integrations/platforms/ecs-with-agent) using EFS for shared secret delivery.

## CI/CD Pipelines

For CI/CD pipelines, the right method depends on the platform.

- On GitHub Actions, the [Infisical Secrets Action](https://github.com/Infisical/secrets-action) provides a native integration that injects secrets as environment variables or `.env` files during workflows. It supports authentication via [AWS IAM](/documentation/platform/identities/aws-auth), [OIDC](/documentation/platform/identities/oidc-auth/github), or [Universal Auth](/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth) using a Machine Identity.
- On other CI platforms like GitLab CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins, the CLI or Agent may be used depending on how secrets are consumed — whether at runtime or during setup.

Some CI/CD systems also support [Secret Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview) as an alternative. Instead of fetching secrets dynamically, you can configure Infisical to forward secrets into [GitHub Actions](/integrations/secret-syncs/github), [GitLab CI](/integrations/secret-syncs/gitlab), and similar platforms ahead of time — allowing them to be used as native environment secrets during jobs.

## Kubernetes Workloads

Infisical supports multiple options for delivering secrets into Kubernetes, each designed to match different operational models and consumption patterns:

- [Infisical Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes/overview): A set of CRDs that sync secrets from Infisical into Kubernetes Secrets, push secrets from Kubernetes back to Infisical, and manage dynamic secrets with automatic leases. Best suited for teams using declarative workflows and wanting to treat secrets as part of infrastructure code.

- [External Secrets Operator (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/infisical/): Enables syncing Infisical secrets into Kubernetes by defining ExternalSecret resources. Ideal if your team already uses ESO as a centralized way to fetch secrets from multiple providers.

- [Infisical Agent Injector](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes-injector): A Kubernetes mutating admission webhook that injects an init container into your pods. The injected container syncs secrets from Infisical into a shared volume at startup, making them available as files. Useful for workloads that expect file-based secrets and where avoiding Kubernetes Secrets entirely is preferred.

- [Infisical CSI Provider](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes-csi): Integrates with the Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver to mount secrets as files in pods. Supports automatic rotation and fine-grained control over how secrets are structured and updated. Suitable for environments that require file-based secret delivery with rotation, without persisting Kubernetes Secrets.

These methods provide secure, declarative integrations with Kubernetes-native workflows.

## Forwarding to Third-Party Platforms

In some cases, secrets must be delivered into systems that can’t fetch them from Infisical directly.

[Secret Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview) allow you to forward secrets to platforms such as [GitHub](/integrations/secret-syncs/github), [GitLab](/integrations/secret-syncs/gitlab), [AWS Secrets Manager](/integrations/secret-syncs/aws-secrets-manager), [Vercel](/integrations/secret-syncs/vercel), and more.

This is useful when external systems require secrets to be available ahead of time or expect them in a specific location.

## Infrastructure-as-Code and Automation Tools

Infisical integrates with common IaC and automation tools to help you securely inject secrets into your infrastructure provisioning workflows:

- [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Infisical/infisical/latest/docs): Use the official Infisical Terraform provider to fetch secrets either as ephemeral resources (never written to state files) or as traditional data sources. Ideal for managing cloud infrastructure while keeping secrets secure and version-safe.
- [Pulumi](/integrations/frameworks/pulumi): Integrate Infisical into Pulumi projects using the Terraform Bridge, allowing you to fetch and manage secrets in TypeScript, Go, Python, or C# — without changing your existing workflows.
- [Ansible](/integrations/platforms/ansible): Retrieve secrets from Infisical at runtime using the official Ansible Collection and lookup plugin. Works well for dynamic configuration during playbook execution.
- [Packer](/integrations/frameworks/packer): Inject secrets into VM or container images at build time using the Infisical Packer Plugin — useful for provisioning base images that require secure configuration values.
