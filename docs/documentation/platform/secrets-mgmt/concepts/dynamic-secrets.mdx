## What is a Dynamic Secret?

A _dynamic secret_ is a time-bound credential generated on demand for a specific user or system. Unlike _static secrets_, which are created and stored ahead of time, or rotated credentials, which are periodically replaced, dynamic secrets don’t exist until they’re requested — and automatically expire shortly after use.

Each secret is unique to the identity that requested it, reducing the risk of reuse, long-term exposure, or accidental leaks. Because they are short-lived and tightly scoped, dynamic secrets are well suited for high-security environments, automated systems, and ephemeral workloads where access needs to be both temporary and auditable.

By limiting the lifespan and visibility of credentials, dynamic secrets offer a strong alternative to managing long-lived secrets manually.

## Dynamic Secrets in Infisical

Infisical generates dynamic secrets in real time when a user or machine identity requests access. Each secret is uniquely scoped to the requesting identity, valid just-in-time only for a limited duration, and automatically revoked after it expires.

Because they are short-lived and identity-specific, dynamic secrets reduce the risk of credential reuse, accidental exposure, or long-term persistence across environments.

When supported for a given integration, using dynamic secrets is strongly recommended. Infisical currently supports dynamic secret templates for commonly used systems including [PostgreSQL](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/postgresql), [MySQL](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/mysql), [Microsoft SQL Server](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/mssql), [MongoDB Atlas](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/mongo-db), [Redis](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/redis), [AWS IAM](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/aws-iam), [GCP IAM](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/gcp-iam), [Azure Entra ID](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/azure-entra-id), and more.
