A secrets management project in Infisical is a dedicated workspace for managing application secrets such as API keys, database credentials, configuration, etc. used by your applications.

Secrets are organized into a clear hierarchy of environments, folders, and individual secrets, making it easy to manage values across different stages of your development lifecycle (e.g., development, staging, production).

## Project environments 

For both visual and organizational structure, Infisical allows splitting up secrets into environments (e.g., development, staging, production). In project settings, such environments can be
customized depending on the intended use case.

## Secrets Overview

The **Secrets Overview** page captures a birds-eye-view of secrets and [folders](/documentation/platform/folder) across environments.
This is useful for comparing secrets, identifying if anything is missing, and making quick changes.

## Secrets Dashboard

The **Secrets Dashboard** page appears when you press to manage the secrets of a specific environment.

### Secrets

To add a secret, press **Add Secret** button at the top of the dashboard.

For a new project, it can be convenient to populate the dashboard by dropping a `.env` file into the provided pane as shown below:

To delete a secret, hover over it and press the **X** button that appears on the right side.

To delete multiple secrets at once, hover over and select the secrets you'd like to delete
and press the **Delete** button that appears at the top.

### Search

To search for specific secrets by their key name, you can use the search bar.

To assist you with finding secrets, you can also group them by similar prefixes and filter them by tags (if applicable).

### Hide/Un-hide

To view/hide all secrets at once, toggle the hide or un-hide button.

### Download as .env

To download/export secrets back into a `.env` file, press the download button.

### Tags

To better organize similar secrets, hover over them and label them with a tag.

### Comments

To provide more context about a given secret, especially for your team, hover over it and press the comment button.

### Personal overrides

Infisical employs the concept of **shared** and **personal** secrets to address the need
for common and custom secret values, or branching, amongst members of a team during software development.
To provide a helpful analogy: A shared value is to a `main` branch as a personal value is to a custom branch.

Consider:

- A team with users A, B, user C.
- A project with an environment containing a shared secret called D with the value E.

Suppose user A overrides the value of secret D with the value F.

Then:

- If user A fetches the secret D back, they get the value F.
- If users B and C fetch the secret D back, they both get the value E.

<Info>
  Please keep in mind that secret reminders won't work with personal overrides.

### Drawer

To view the full details of each secret, you can hover over it and press on the ellipses button.

This opens up a side-drawer:
