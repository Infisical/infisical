Infisical provides a flexible platform for managing application secrets — such as API keys, database credentials, application configuration, and more — across every stage of the development lifecycle from local development to production.

It helps teams eliminate hardcoded secrets, enforce access controls, and adopt secure workflows like secret rotation, dynamic secrets, and secrets syncs to external platforms.

Core capabilities include:

- Secret Stores: Secure, versioned storage scoped by [project](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/project), [environment](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/project#project-environments), and [path](/documentation/platform/folder).
- [Access Control](/documentation/platform/access-controls/overview): Fine-grained, identity-aware permissions for users and machines
- Secret Delivery: Access secrets via [CLI](/cli/overview), [SDKs](/sdks/overview) (Go, Node.js, Python, etc.), [HTTP API](/api-reference/overview/introduction), [agents](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent), [Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes/overview), [External Secrets Operator (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/infisical), and more.
- Lifecycle Automation: Automate [secret rotation](/documentation/platform/secret-rotation/overview), generate [dynamic secrets](/documentation/platform/dynamic-secrets/overview), and enforce [approval-based workflows](/documentation/platform/pr-workflows).
- [Secrets Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview): Push secrets to external services like [GitHub](/integrations/secret-syncs/github), [GitLab](/integrations/secret-syncs/gitlab), [AWS Secrets Manager](/integrations/secret-syncs/aws-secrets-manager), [Vercel](/integrations/secret-syncs/vercel), and more.
