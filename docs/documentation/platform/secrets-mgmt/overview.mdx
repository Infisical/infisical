Infisical provides a flexible platform for managing secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and application configuration across every stage of the development lifecycle — from local development to production. It enables teams to eliminate hardcoded secrets, enforce fine-grained access controls, deliver secrets across their infrastructure, and adopt secure workflows like secret rotation and dynamic secrets.

The short video below provides a guided overview of Infisical's secrets management capabilities and key concepts, helping you build the right mental model before diving into the rest of the documentation.

- [Access Control](/documentation/platform/access-controls/overview): Fine-grained, identity-aware permissions for users and machines
- [Secret Delivery](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-delivery): Access secrets via [CLI](/cli/overview), [SDKs](/sdks/overview) (Go, Node.js, Python, etc.), [HTTP API](/api-reference/overview/introduction), [agents](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent), [Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes/overview), [External Secrets Operator (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/infisical), and more.
- Lifecycle Automation: Automate [secret rotation](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/secrets-rotation), generate [dynamic secrets](/documentation/platform/secrets-mgmt/concepts/dynamic-secrets), and enforce [approval-based workflows](/documentation/platform/pr-workflows).
- [Secrets Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview): Push secrets to external services like [GitHub](/integrations/secret-syncs/github), [GitLab](/integrations/secret-syncs/gitlab), [AWS Secrets Manager](/integrations/secret-syncs/aws-secrets-manager), [Vercel](/integrations/secret-syncs/vercel), and more.
