<Info>
  **Note:** Event Subscriptions is a paid feature. - **Infisical Cloud users:**
  Event Subscriptions is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. -
  **Self-Hosted Infisical:** Please contact
  [sales@infisical.com](mailto:sales@infisical.com) to purchase an enterprise
  license.
</Info>

Event Subscriptions in Infisical allow you to receive real-time notifications when specific actions occur within your account or organization. These notifications include changes to secrets, users, teams, and many more **coming soon**.

## How It Works

- Server receives message over pubsub connection indicating changes have occurred
- Server processes the change notification
- Updated data is synchronized across all connected Infisical instances
- Client applications receive real-time updates through [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
- All servers maintain consistent state without manual intervention

This ensures your infrastructure stays up-to-date automatically, without requiring restarts or manual synchronization.

<Note>
  Event Subscriptions are designed for real-time communication and do not
  include persistence or replay capabilitiesâ€”events are delivered once and are
  not stored for future retrieval.
</Note>

## Supported Resources

You can currently subscribe to notifications for the following resources and event types:

- **Secrets**
  - `secret:created`: Triggered when a secret is created
  - `secret:updated`: Triggered when a secret is updated
  - `secret:deleted`: Triggered when a secret is deleted

## Permissions Setup

To receive events on a supported resource, the identity must have `Subscribe` action permission on that resource.

Follow these steps to set up the necessary permissions:

<Steps>
 <Step title="Select a project and copy the Project ID">
   ![Select Project](/images/platform/events/select-project.png)

On your project page, open **Project Settings** from the sidebar.

In the Project name section, click **Copy Project ID** to copy your Project ID, or extract it from the URL:
`https://app.infisical.com/project/<your_project_id>/settings`

 </Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Access Management and open Project Roles">
  ![Project Detail](/images/platform/events/project-detail.png) ![Project
  Access](/images/platform/events/project-access.png) Navigate to **Access
  Management**, then select **Project Roles**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select an existing role or create a new one">
  ![Project Role](/images/platform/events/project-role.png) You can either edit
  an existing role or create a new role for event subscriptions.
</Step>

<Step title="Assign policies to the role">
  ![Role Detail](/images/platform/events/role-detail.png) Select the specific
  resources that the role should have access to. ![Add
  policy](/images/platform/events/add-policy.png)
</Step>

 <Step title="Enable the Subscribe action in permissions">
   ![Policy setting](/images/platform/events/policy-setting.png)

Ensure the **Subscribe** action is selected for the relevant resources and events.

   <AccordionGroup>
     <Accordion title="Add conditions to your permissions">
       By default, the role will have access to all events for the selected resources in this project. If needed, you can add filters to limit the scope of accessible events.

     </Accordion>

   </AccordionGroup>
 </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

Currently, events are only available via [API](/api-reference/endpoints/events) but will soon be available in our SDKs, Kubernetes Operator, and more.

### API Authentication

<Steps>
 <Step title="Navigate to Organization Access Control and select an Identity">

Select or create an identity you want to create the token for.

 </Step>

 <Step title="Assign a project and role to the Identity">
   ![Add identity role](/images/platform/events/identity-add-role.png)

Select a project and the role you previously configured in the [permissions setup](#permissions-setup) section.

### API Usage

#### Creating a Subscription

![Postman Subscription](/images/platform/events/postman-subscribe.png)

**Request Parameters:**

- `projectId`: Project whose events you want to subscribe to
- `register`: List of event filters
  - `conditions`: Conditions to filter events on
    - `environmentSlug`: Project environment
    - `secretPath`: Path of the secrets

![Postman Subscription Response](/images/platform/events/postman-sse-response.png)

The subscribe endpoint responds with a `text/event-stream` content type to initiate SSE streaming.

For more specific details, please refer to our [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoints/events).
