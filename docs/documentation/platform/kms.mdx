## Concept

Infisical can be used as a Key Management System (KMS), referred to as Infisical KMS, to centralize management of keys to be used for cryptographic operations like encryption/decryption.

<Note>
  Keys managed in KMS are not extractable from the platform. Additionally, data
  is never stored when performing cryptographic operations.
</Note>

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using Infisical KMS consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a KMS key. As part of this step, you specify a name for the key and the encryption algorithm meant to be used for it (e.g. `AES-GCM-128`, `AES-GCM-256`).
2. Encryption: To encrypt data, you would make a request to the Infisical KMS API endpoint, specifying the base64-encoded plaintext and the intended key to use for encryption; the API would return the base64-encoded ciphertext.
3. Decryption: To decrypt data, you would make a request to the Infisical KMS API endpoint, specifying the base64-encoded ciphertext and the intended key to use for decryption; the API would return the base64-encoded plaintext.

<Note>
  Note that this workflow can be executed via the Infisical UI or manually such
  as via API.

## Guide to Encrypting Data

In the following steps, we explore how to generate a key and use it to encrypt data.

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Creating a KMS key">
                Navigate to Project > Key Management and tap on the **Add Key** button.

                Specify your key details. Here's some guidance on each field:

                - Name: A slug-friendly name for the key.
                - Type: The encryption algorithm associated with the key (e.g. `AES-GCM-256`).
                - Description: An optional description of what the intended usage is for the key.

            </Step>
            <Step title="Encrypting data with the KMS key">
                Once your key is generated, open the options menu for the newly created key and select encrypt data.

                <Note>
                    If your data is already Base64 encoded make sure to toggle the respective switch on to avoid
                    redundant encoding.
                </Note>

                Copy and store the encrypted data.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data stored in Infisical KMS?">
    No. Infisical's KMS only provides cryptographic services and does not store
    any encrypted or decrypted data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can key material be accessed outside of Infisical KMS?">
    No. Infisical's KMS will never expose your keys, encrypted or decrypted, to
    external sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What algorithms does Infisical KMS support?">
    Currently, Infisical only supports `AES-128-GCM` and `AES-256-GCM` for
    encryption operations. We anticipate supporting more algorithms and
    cryptographic operations in the coming months.
