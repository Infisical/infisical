A project houses application configuration and secrets for an application.

## Secrets Overview

The **Secrets Overview** page captures a birds-eye-view of secrets and folders across environments like development, staging, or production. 
This is useful for comparing secrets, identifying if anything is missing, and making quick changes.

## Secrets Dashboard

The **Secrets Dashboard** page appears when you press to manage the secrets of a specific environment.

### Secrets

To add a secret, press **Add Secret** button at the top of the dashboard.

For a new project, it can be convenient to populate the dashboard by dropping a `.env` file into the provided pane as shown below:

![project drop env file](../../images/platform/project/project-secrets-drop-env.png)

To delete a secret, hover over it and press the **X** button that appears on the right side.

![project delete secret](../../images/platform/project/project-secrets-delete.png)

To delete multiple secrets at once, hover over and select the secrets you'd like to delete
and press the **Delete** button that appears at the top.

### Search

To search for specific secrets by their key name, you can use the search bar.

![project search](../../images/platform/project/project-secrets-search.png)

To assist you with finding secrets, you can also group them by similar prefixes and filter them by tags (if applicable).

![project filter](../../images/platform/project/project-secrets-filter.png)

### Hide/Un-hide

To view/hide all secrets at once, toggle the hide or un-hide button.

### Download as .env

To download/export secrets back into a `.env` file, press the download button.

### Tags

To better organize similar secrets, hover over them and label them with a tag.

### Comments

To provide more context about a given secret, especially for your team, hover over it and press the comment button.

### Personal overrides

Infisical employs the concept of **shared** and **personal** secrets to address the need
for common and custom secret values, or branching, amongst members of a team during software development.
To provide a helpful analogy: A shared value is to a `main` branch as a personal value is to a custom branch.

Consider:

- A team with users A, B, user C.
- A project with an environment containing a shared secret called D with the value E.

Suppose user A overrides the value of secret D with the value F.

Then:

- If user A fetches the secret D back, they get the value F.
- If users B and C fetch the secret D back, they both get the value E.

### Drawer

To view the full details of each secret, you can hover over it and press on the ellipses button.

This opens up a side-drawer:
