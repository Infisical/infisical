Infisical SSH provides a secure, certificate-based solution for managing SSH access to infrastructure.
It replaces long-lived SSH keys with short-lived, identity-bound certificates to reduce key sprawl, simplify access control, and improve auditability.

Core capabilities include:

- Certificate Authority (CA): Managed CA infrastructure for issuing short-lived SSH certificates.
- Centralized Access Management: View all registered hosts, see who has access to each, and control permissions from a single interface.
- Easy Host Registration & Connection: Quickly register hosts and connect using short-lived certificates without manual key distribution.
- Audit Logging: Detailed records of certificate issuance and SSH access activity.
