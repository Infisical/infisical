Point-in-time recovery allows secrets to be rolled back to any point in time. 
It's powered by snapshots that get created after every mutations to a secret within a given [folder](./folder) and environment.

## Commits

Similar to Git, a commit in Infisical is a snapshot of your project's secrets at a specific point in time scoped to the environment and [folder](./folder) it is in. You can browse and view your project's snapshots via the "Point-in-Time Recovery" sidebar.

## Rolling back

Secrets can be rolled back to any point in time via the "Rollback to this snapshot" button. This will roll back the changes within the given [folder](./folder) and environment to the chosen time.

It's important to note that this rollback action is localized and does not affect other folders within the same environment. This means each [folder](./folder) maintains its own independent history of changes, offering precise and isolated control over rollback actions.
In essence, every [folder](./folder) possesses a distinct and separate timeline, providing granular control when managing your secrets.

<Note>
  Rolling back secrets to a past snapshot creates a new commit,
  creates a snapshot at the top of the stack and updates secret versions.
