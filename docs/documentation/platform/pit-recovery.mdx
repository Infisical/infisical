Infisical's point-in-time recovery feature allows secrets to be rolled back to any point in time for any given [folder](./folder).
Under the hood, snapshots, capturing the state of the folder, get taken after any mutation an item within that folder.

## Snapshots

Similar to Git, a commit (aka snapshot) in Infisical is the state of your project's secrets at a specific point in time scoped to 
an environment and [folder](./folder) within it.

To view a list of snapshots for the current folder, press the **Commits** button.

This opens up a sidebar from which you can select to view a particular snapshot:

## Rolling back

After pressing on a snapshot from the sidebar, you can view it and even roll back the state
of the folder to that point in time by pressing the **Rollback** button.

Rolling back secrets to a past snapshot creates a creates a snapshot at the top of the stack and updates secret versions.

Note that rollbacks are localized to not affect other folders within the same environment. This means each [folder](./folder) maintains its own independent history of changes, offering precise and isolated control over rollback actions.
Put differently, every [folder](./folder) possesses a distinct and separate timeline, providing granular control when managing your secrets.
