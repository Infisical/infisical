Infisical provides two approaches for migrating from HashiCorp Vault.

### Which approach should I use?

**Choose In-Platform Migration Tooling if you want to:**

- Migrate specific secrets, not everything at once
- Import secrets into existing Infisical projects
- Translate Vault policies to Infisical access controls
- Import Kubernetes authentication configurations
- Have more control over the migration process

**Choose Bulk Data Import if you want to:**

- Migrate all secrets from Vault in one go
- Automatically create new Infisical projects from your Vault structure
- Perform a one-time migration when moving entirely from Vault to Infisical

## In-Platform Migration Tooling

This migration approach lets you set up a connection to your Vault instance once, then import specific resources as needed throughout Infisical.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Vault Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Vault policy">
    In your Vault instance, create a policy that allows Infisical to read your secrets, policies, and authentication configurations. This policy grants read-only access and doesn't allow Infisical to modify anything in Vault.

    <Accordion title="View the complete policy">
    ```python
    # System endpoints - for listing namespaces, policies, mounts, and auth methods
    path "sys/namespaces" {
      capabilities = ["list"]
    }

    path "sys/policy" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    path "sys/policy/*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    path "sys/mounts" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    path "sys/auth" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    # KV v2 secrets - for listing and reading secrets
    # Replace '+' with your actual KV v2 mount paths (e.g., "secret", "kv")
    path "+/metadata/*" {
      capabilities = ["list", "read"]
    }

    path "+/data/*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    # KV v1 secrets - for listing and reading secrets
    # Replace '+' with your actual KV v1 mount paths (e.g., "secret", "kv-v1")
    # WARNING: This is broad - ideally specify exact mount names
    path "+/*" {
      capabilities = ["list", "read"]
    }

    # Kubernetes auth - for reading auth configuration and roles
    path "auth/+/config" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    path "auth/+/role" {
      capabilities = ["list"]
    }

    path "auth/+/role/*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    ```
    </Accordion>

    Save this policy in Vault with the name `infisical-in-platform-migration`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an App Connection in Infisical">
    In Infisical, navigate to **Organization Settings > App Connections** and create a new HashiCorp Vault connection.

    Follow the [HashiCorp Vault App Connection documentation](/integrations/app-connections/hashicorp-vault) for detailed setup instructions. When configuring authentication (Token or AppRole), make sure it uses the `infisical-in-platform-migration` policy you created.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Vault Namespaces for Migration">
    Navigate to **Organization Settings > External Migrations** in Infisical.

    Under the "In-Platform Migration Tooling" section for HashiCorp Vault, click **"+ Add Namespace"**.

    ![In-Platform Migration Tooling](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/external-migration-overview.png)

    Configure your namespace:

    ![Namespace Configuration](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/namespace-configuration-modal.png)

    - **Namespace**: Enter your Vault namespace path (e.g., `admin/namespace1`). If you intend to use the root namespace, set the namespace value to "root".
    - **Connection**: Select the App Connection you created in the previous step.

    <Note>
    You can add multiple namespaces with different connections if you have multiple Vault instances or namespaces to migrate from.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Import Your Resources

Once your Vault connection is configured, you'll see import options throughout Infisical wherever relevant. Here's what you can import:

#### Import Secrets into a Project

You can import secrets from Vault directly into a specific environment and secret path:

1. Navigate to your project and select a specific environment (e.g., Development, Production)
2. In the secrets view, click the dropdown icon (caret) next to the **"+ Add Secret"** button
3. Select **"Add from HashiCorp Vault"**

   ![Import Vault Secrets](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/import-vault-secrets-modal.png)

4. Choose your Vault namespace and the secret path you want to import
5. Click **"Import Secrets"**

The secrets will be imported into your current environment and folder path.

#### Import Kubernetes Authentication Configurations

When setting up Kubernetes authentication for a machine identity, you can import the configuration from Vault:

1. Navigate to **Access Control > Machine Identities** and select an identity
2. Click **"Add Authentication Method"** and choose **Kubernetes Auth**
3. In the configuration modal, click **"Load from Vault"**

   ![Load Kubernetes Auth from Vault](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/import-vault-kubernetes-auth-modal.png)

4. Select your Vault namespace and the Kubernetes role
5. Click **"Load"**

   ![Kubernetes Auth Form Populated](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/import-vault-kubernetes-auth-modal-form.png)

The authentication settings (service accounts, TTL, policies, etc.) will be automatically populated from your Vault configuration.

<Note>
  Sensitive values like service account JWTs cannot be retrieved from Vault and
  must be manually provided in the form after importing the configuration.
</Note>

#### Import and Translate Access Control Policies

When configuring project role-based access control, you can import Vault HCL policies and automatically translate them to Infisical permissions:

1. Navigate to your project, then go to **Access Control > Roles** and create or edit a role
2. In the policy configuration, click **"Add from HashiCorp Vault"**

   ![Import Vault Policy Button](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/translate-vault-policy-toggle.png)

3. Select your Vault namespace
4. Either choose an existing policy from the dropdown or paste your own HCL policy

   ![Translate Vault Policy Modal](/images/platform/external-migrations/vault-in-platform/translate-vault-policy-modal.png)

5. Review the automatically translated Infisical permissions
6. Make any adjustments and save

**How policy translation works:**

- Vault path patterns are analyzed to identify KV secret engines and environments
- Vault capabilities (`read`, `list`, `create`, etc.) are mapped to Infisical permissions
- Wildcards in paths are converted to glob patterns
- Secret paths are preserved for granular access control

## Bulk Data Import

This migration approach imports all secrets from your Vault instance in one operation and automatically creates new Infisical projects based on your Vault structure.

### Understanding Project Mapping

Before starting the bulk import, you need to decide how your Vault structure will map to Infisical projects:

<Accordion title="Namespace Mapping (One Project Per Namespace)">
  Each Vault namespace becomes a single Infisical project, with each KV secret engine becoming an environment within that project.

  **Example:** If you have a namespace with 3 KV secret engines (`dev-secrets`, `staging-secrets`, `prod-secrets`):

  - Creates: 1 Infisical project
  - Environments: 3 (`dev-secrets`, `staging-secrets`, `prod-secrets`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key Vault Mapping (One Project Per KV Engine)">
  Each KV secret engine becomes its own Infisical project with a single `Production` environment.

  **Example:** If you have 3 KV secret engines (`dev-secrets`, `staging-secrets`, `prod-secrets`):

  - Creates: 3 Infisical projects (`dev-secrets`, `staging-secrets`, `prod-secrets`)
  - Each project has: 1 environment (`Production`)
</Accordion>

### How to Perform a Bulk Import

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Vault policy for bulk import">
    In your Vault instance, create a policy that allows Infisical to read all secrets and metadata. This policy grants read-only access.

    <Accordion title="View the bulk import policy">
    ```python
    # Allow listing secret engines/mounts
    path "sys/mounts" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    # For KV v2 engines - access to both data and metadata
    path "*/data/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    path "*/metadata/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    # If using Vault Enterprise - allow listing namespaces
    path "sys/namespaces" {
      capabilities = ["list", "read"]
    }

    # Cross-namespace access (Enterprise only)
    path "+/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    path "+/sys/mounts" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }
    ```
    </Accordion>

    Save this policy in Vault with the name `infisical-bulk-migration`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate an access token">
    Use the Vault CLI to generate an access token:

    ```bash
    vault token create --policy="infisical-bulk-migration"
    ```

    Copy the `token` value from the output - you'll need it in the next step.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the import in Infisical">
    In Infisical, navigate to **Organization Settings > External Migrations**.

    ![Infisical Organization settings](/images/platform/external-migrations/infisical-external-migration-dashboard.png)

    Under the "Bulk Data Import" section, click **"+ Import"**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Vault as the source">
    Select **HashiCorp Vault** as the migration source and click **Next**.

    ![Select Vault platform](/images/platform/external-migrations/infisical-import-vault-modal.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure and start the migration">
    Fill in your Vault connection details:

    ![Configure Vault migration](/images/platform/external-migrations/infisical-import-vault.png)

    - **Vault URL**: Your Vault instance URL (e.g., `https://vault.example.com`)
    - **Vault Namespace**: Optional - only needed if using Vault Enterprise namespaces
    - **Vault Access Token**: The token you generated in step 2
    - **Project Mapping**: Choose how to structure your Infisical projects (see [Understanding Project Mapping](#understanding-project-mapping))

    Click **"Import Data"** to start the migration.

    <Note>
    The import runs in the background and may take several minutes. You'll receive an email when it completes.
    </Note>
