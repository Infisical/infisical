## Overview

Infisical supports migrating resources from third-party secrets management platforms to Infisical. This is useful if you're looking to easily switch to Infisical and wish to move over your existing resources from a different platform.

Infisical offers two types of migration approaches:

- **In-Platform Migration Tooling**: Configure platform connections to enable granular, on-demand imports of secrets, policies, and configurations directly within the Infisical UI. This allows you to migrate resources incrementally as needed.

- **Bulk Data Import**: Perform one-time organization-level migrations to import all resources from external platforms at once. This is ideal for initial migrations when moving entirely to Infisical.

## Supported Platforms

- [EnvKey](./envkey)
- [Vault](./vault)

We're always looking to add more migration paths for other providers. If we're missing a platform, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/infisical/infisical/issues).
