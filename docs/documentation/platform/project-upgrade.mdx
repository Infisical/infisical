title: "Enhancing Security and Usability: Project Upgrades"
---

At Infisical, we're constantly striving to elevate the security and usability standards of our platform to better serve our users.
With this commitment in mind, we're excited to introduce our latest addition, non-E2EE projects, aimed at addressing two significant issues while enhancing how clients interact with Infisical programmatically.

Previously, users encountered a challenge where projects risked becoming inaccessible if the project creator deleted their account.
Additionally, our API lacked the capability to interact with projects without dealing with complex cryptographic operations.
These obstacles made API driven automation and collaboration a painful experience for a majority of our users.

To overcome these limitations, our upgrade focuses on disabling end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for projects.
While this may raise eyebrows, it's important to understand that this decision is a strategic move to make Infisical easier to use and interact with.

But what does this mean for our users? Essentially nothing, there are no changes required on your end.
Rest assured, all sensitive data remains encrypted at rest according to the latest industry standards.
Our commitment to security remains unwavering, and this upgrade is a testament to our dedication to delivering on our promises in both security and usability when it comes to secrets management.

To increase consistency with existing and future integrations, all projects created on Infisical from now on will have end-to-end encryption (E2EE) disabled by default.
This will not only reduce confusion for end users, but will also make the Infisical API seamless to use.
