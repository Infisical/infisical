## What is Infisical? 

[Infisical](https://infisical.com) is an open-source all-in-one secret management platform that helps developers manage secrets (e.g., API-keys, DB access tokens, [certificates](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/pki/overview)) across their infrastructure. In addition, Infisical provides [secret sharing](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/secret-sharing) functionality, ability to [prevent secret leaks](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/scanning-overview), and more.

Infisical is used by 10,000+ organizations across all industries including First American Financial Corporation, Delivery Hero, and [Hugging Face](https://infisical.com/customers/hugging-face).
