title: "Next.js + Vercel"
---


This guide demonstrates how to use Infisical to manage secrets for your Next.js + Vercel stack from local development to production. It uses:

- Infisical (you can use [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com) or a [self-hosted instance of Infisical](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/overview)) to store your secrets.

## Project Setup

To begin, we need to set up a project in Infisical and add secrets to an environment in it.

### Create a project

1. Create a new project in [Infisical](https://app.infisical.com/).

2. Add a secret to the development environment of this project so we can pull it back for local development. In the **Secrets Overview** page, press **Explore Development** and add a secret with the key `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME` and value `YOUR_NAME`.

3. Add a secret to the production environment of this project so we can sync it to Vercel. Switch to the **Production** environment and add a secret with the key `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME` and value `ANOTHER_NAME`.

## Create a Next.js app

Initialize a new Node.js app.

We can use `create-next-app` to initialize an app called `infisical-nextjs`.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```console
        npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm infisical-nextjs
        cd infisical-nextjs
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">
        ```console
        npx create-next-app@latest --ts --use-npm infisical-nextjs
        cd infisical-nextjs
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, inside `pages/_app.js`, lets add a `console.log()` to print out the environment variable in the browser console.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import '@/styles/globals.css'

    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
        console.log('Hello, ', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME);
        return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```tsx
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
        console.log('Hello, ', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME);
        return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Infisical CLI for local development environment variables

We'll now use the Infisical CLI to fetch secrets from Infisical into your Next.js app for local development.

### CLI Installation

Follow the instructions for your operating system to install the Infisical CLI.

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="MacOS">
  	Use [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager

    	```console
    	$ brew install infisical/get-cli/infisical
    	```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Windows">
      Use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) package manager

        ```console
        $ scoop bucket add org https://github.com/Infisical/scoop-infisical.git
        ```

        ```console
        $ scoop install infisical
        ```
   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="Alpine">
	 Install prerequisite
		```console
		$ apk add --no-cache bash sudo
		```

    	Add Infisical repository
    	```console
    	$ curl -1sLf \
    		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-cli/setup.alpine.sh' \
    		| bash
    	```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ apk update && sudo apk add infisical
    	```

   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="RedHat/CentOs/Amazon">
	 Add Infisical repository
		```console
		$ curl -1sLf \
		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-cli/setup.rpm.sh' \
		| sudo -E bash
		```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ sudo yum install infisical
    	```

   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="Debian/Ubuntu">
	 	Add Infisical repository 
			
		```console
		$ curl -1sLf \
		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-cli/setup.deb.sh' \
		| sudo -E bash
		```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y infisical
    	```

   </Tab>
	<Tab title="Arch Linux">
		Use the `yay` package manager to install from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/infisical-bin)
			
		```console
		$ yay -S infisical-bin
		```

   </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Login

Authenticate the CLI with the Infisical platform using your email and password.

```console
$ infisical login
```

### Initialization

Run the `init` command at the root of the Next.js app. This step connects your local project to the project on the Infisical platform and creates a `infisical.json` file containing a reference to that latter project.

```console
$ infisical init
```

### Start the Next.js app with secrets injected as environment variables

```console
$ infisical run -- npm run dev
```

If you open your browser console, **Hello, YOUR_NAME** should be printed out.

Here, the CLI fetched the secret from Infisical and injected it into the Next.js app upon starting up. By default,
the CLI fetches secrets from the development environment which has the slug `dev`; you can inject secrets from different
environments by modifying the `env` flag as per the [CLI documentation](/cli/usage).

At this stage, you know how to use the Infisical CLI to inject secrets into your Next.js app for local development.

## Infisical-Vercel integration for production environment variables

We'll now use the Infisical-Vercel integration send secrets from Infisical to Vercel as production environment variables.

### Infisical-Vercel integration

To begin we have to import the Next.js app into Vercel as a project. [Follow these instructions](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy) to deploy the Next.js app to Vercel.

Next, navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical and press on the Vercel tile to grant Infisical access to your Vercel account.

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

![integrations vercel authorization](../../images/integrations-vercel-auth.png)

<Note>
    Opting in for the Infisical-Vercel integration will break end-to-end encryption since Infisical will be able to read
    your secrets. This is, however, necessary for Infisical to sync the secrets to Vercel.

    Your secrets remain encrypted at rest following our [security guide mechanics](/security/mechanics).
</Note>

Now select **Production** for (the source) **Environment** and sync it to the **Production Environment** of the (target) application in Vercel.
Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Vercel.

![integrations vercel](../../images/integrations-vercel-create.png)
![integrations vercel](../../images/integrations-vercel.png)

You should now see your secret from Infisical appear as production environment variables in your Vercel project.

At this stage, you know how to use the Infisical-Vercel integration to sync production secrets from Infisical to Vercel.

<Warning>
  The following environment variable names are reserved by Vercel and cannot be
  synced: `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`, `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`,
  `NOW_REGION`, `TZ`, `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`, `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`,
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`,
  `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why should I use Infisical if I can centralize all my Next.js + Vercel environment variables across all environments directly in Vercel?">
        Vercel does not specialize in secret management which means it lacks many useful features for effectively managing environment variables.
        Here are some features that teams benefit from by using Infisical together with Vercel:

        - Audit logs: See which team members are creating, reading, updating, and deleting environment variables across all environments.
        - Versioning and point in time recovery: Rolling back secrets and an entire project state.
        - Overriding secrets that should be unique amongst team members.

        And much more.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is opting out of end-to-end encryption for the Infisical-Vercel integration safe?">
        Yes. Your secrets are still encrypted at rest. To note, most secret managers actually don't support end-to-end encryption.
        
        Check out the [security guide](/security/overview).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is there way to retain end-to-end encryption for syncing production secrets to Vercel?">
        Yes. You can also use the Infisical [Node SDK](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-node) to fetch secrets back to your Next.js app
        in both development and production.

        Depending on how you use it, however, it may require certain pages to be server-side rendered.
