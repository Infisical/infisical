Infisical provides a flexible interface for integrating into development workflows and infrastructure. Around it is a rich ecosystem of clients and integrations that allow users and systems to interact with Infisical across any environment.

These clients enable access to secrets, certificates, and other resources from wherever they’re needed—whether that’s a developer’s terminal, a CI/CD pipeline, or a running Kubernetes workload.

## Available Clients and Interfaces

Infisical offers a non-exhaustive set of clients and interfaces to support a wide range of use cases:

- [CLI](/cli/overview): A powerful command-line interface for developers and operators to interact with Infisical from local or automated environments. Commonly used for secret access, SSH credential issuance, and more.

- [SDKs](/sdks/overview): Official client libraries for languages like Go, Node.js, and Python make it easy to integrate Infisical directly into applications and internal tooling.

- [HTTP API](/api-reference/overview/introduction): A fully documented RESTful API powers all core functionality and enables advanced or custom integrations.

- [Agents](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent): Lightweight background processes that can fetch and sync secrets or credentials into local environments, containers, or file systems.

- [Kubernetes Operator](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes/overview): A native controller that syncs Infisical secrets into Kubernetes as native Secrets, and supports secure workload integration.

- [External Secrets Operator (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/infisical): Allows Infisical to act as a backend provider for syncing secrets into Kubernetes `Secret` objects using the widely adopted External Secrets Operator.

- [Kubernetes PKI Issuer](/documentation/platform/pki/pki-issuer): A controller that issues X.509 certificates from Infisical PKI using the cert-manager Issuer and Certificate CRDs.

- [Secret Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview): Native integrations to forward secrets to services like GitHub, GitLab, AWS Secrets Manager, Vercel, and more.

This modular ecosystem lets teams use Infisical alongside their existing stack—without requiring opinionated workflows or lock-in.
