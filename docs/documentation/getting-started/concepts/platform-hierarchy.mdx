Infisical is structured around organizations and projects, allowing teams to manage multiple products, access scopes, and use cases within a single account while keeping boundaries and responsibilities clearly defined.

## Organizations

An [organization](/documentation/platform/organization) typically represents a company or high-level entity (e.g. Acme Corp). It acts as the umbrella for all projects, members, and billing settings.

[Users](/documentation/platform/identities/user-identities) are invited to an organization and assigned [organization-level roles](/documentation/platform/access-controls/role-based-access-controls#organization-level-access-controls) that determine what they can manage—such as members, machine identities, and billing details.

## Projects

A [project](/documentation/platform/project) belongs to an organization and defines a specific scope of work. Each project has a product type such as Secrets Management, PAM, or PKI that determines what features are available in that project.

For example:

- A Secrets Management project manages application secrets across environments.

- A PAM project enables access management for infrastructure.

- A PKI project manages certificate authorities and X.509 certificate workflows.

Users are added to a project and assigned [project-level roles](/documentation/platform/access-controls/role-based-access-controls#project-level-access-controls) that determine what they can manage—such as secrets, access policies, or certificate authorities. A user can have different roles across projects, allowing for flexible and fine-grained access control that reflects how teams operate in practice.

## Key Characteristics

- Projects are isolated in terms of configuration, permissions, and product workflows.

- Access is managed independently at both the organization and project level.

- All projects within an organization share the same billing and user directory.

Teams can adopt Infisical incrementally—starting with one product and expanding as needed.
