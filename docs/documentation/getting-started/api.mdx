Infisical's Public (REST) API is the most flexible, platform-agnostic way to read/write secrets for your application.

Prerequisites:

- Have a project with secrets ready in [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com).
- Create an [Infisical Token](/documentation/platform/token) scoped to an environment in your project in Infisical.

To keep it simple, we're going to fetch secrets from the API with **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** disabled.

<Note>
    It's possible to use the API with **E2EE** enabled but this means learning about how encryption works with Infisical and performing client-side encryption/decryption operations yourself.
    yourself. 
    
    If **E2EE** is a must for your team, we recommend either using one of the [Infisical SDKs](/documentation/getting-started/sdks) or checking out the [examples for E2EE](/api-reference/overview/examples/e2ee-disabled).
</Note>

## Configuration

Head to your Project Settings, where you created your service token, and un-check the **E2EE** setting.

## Retrieve Secret

Retrieve a secret from the project and environment in Infisical scoped to your service token by making a HTTP request with the following format/details:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://app.infisical.com/api/v3/secrets/raw/secretName?workspaceId=workspaceId&environment=environment' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer serviceToken'
```

<ParamField path="secretName" type="string" required>
    Name of secret to retrieve
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="workspaceId" type="string" required>
    The ID of the workspace
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="environment" type="string" required>
    The environment slug
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="secretPath" type="string" default="/" optional>
    Path to secrets in workspace
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="type" type="string" optional default="personal">
    The type of the secret. Valid options are “shared” or “personal”
</ParamField>

Depending on your application requirements, you may wish to use Infisical's API in different ways such as by retaining **E2EE**
or fetching multiple secrets at once instead of one at a time.

Whatever the case, we recommend glossing over the [API Examples](/api-reference/overview/examples/note)
to gain a deeper understanding of how you to best leverage the Infisical API for your use-case.
