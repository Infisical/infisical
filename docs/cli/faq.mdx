By default, the CLI will choose the most suitable store available on your system. 
If you experience issues with the default store, you can switch to a different one. 
If none of the available stores work for you, you can try using the `file` store type by running `infisical vault set file`, which should work in most cases. 
If you are still experiencing trouble, please seek support.

<Accordion title="Can I fetch secrets with Infisical if I am offline?">
Yes. If you have previously retrieved secrets for a specific project and environment (such as dev, staging, or prod), the  `run`/`secret` command will utilize the saved secrets, even when offline, on subsequent fetch attempts.
