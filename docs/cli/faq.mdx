<Accordion title="I'm getting a Keyring related error message when trying to login" defaultOpen="true">
By default, the CLI will choose the most suitable store available on your system. 
If you experience issues with the default store, you can switch to a different one. 
If none of the available stores work for you, you can try using the `file` store type by running `infisical vault set file`, which should work in most cases. 
If you are still experiencing trouble, please seek support.

<Accordion title="Can I fetch secrets with Infisical if I am offline?">
Yes. If you have previously retrieved secrets for a specific project and environment (such as dev, staging, or prod), the  `run`/`secret` command will utilize the saved secrets, even when offline, on subsequent fetch attempts.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I upload the .infisical.json file that was generated?">
Yes. This is simply a configuration file and contains no sensitive data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find my Project ID?">

  Visit the Infisical website and navigate to a project of your choice. Once on the project page, access the **Project Settings** from the sidebar. Within the Project name section, click the "Copy Project ID" button for copying the current Project ID to clipboard, or simply obtain it from the URL of the current page.

<Accordion title="How do I use custom headers with the Infisical CLI?">
  
  The Infisical CLI supports custom HTTP headers for requests to servers that require additional authentication. Set these headers using the `INFISICAL_CUSTOM_HEADERS` environment variable:
  
  ```bash
  export INFISICAL_CUSTOM_HEADERS="Access-Client-Id=your-client-id Access-Client-Secret=your-client-secret"
  ```
  
  After setting this environment variable, run your Infisical commands as usual.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why would I need to use custom headers?">
  
  Custom headers are necessary when your Infisical server is protected by services like Cloudflare Access or other reverse proxies that require specific authentication headers. Without this feature, you would need to implement security workarounds that might compromise your security posture.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What format should I use for the custom headers?">
  
  Custom headers should be specified in the format `headername1=headervalue1 headername2=headervalue2`, with spaces separating each header-value pair. For example:
  
  ```bash
  export INFISICAL_CUSTOM_HEADERS="Header1=value1 Header2=value2 Header3=value3"
  ```
