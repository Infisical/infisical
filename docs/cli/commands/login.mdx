```bash
infisical login

## Description
The CLI uses authentication to verify your identity. When you enter the correct email and password for your account, a token is generated and saved in your system Keyring to allow you to make future interactions with the CLI. 

To change where the login credentials are stored, visit the [vaults command](./vault).

If you have added multiple users, you can switch between the users by using the [user command](./user).
