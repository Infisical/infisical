## Description

To safeguard your login details when using the CLI, Infisical places them in a system vault or an encrypted text file, protected by a passphrase that only the user knows.

<Tip>To avoid constantly entering your passphrase when using the `file` vault type, use the `infisical vault set file --passphrase <your-passphrase>` CLI command to specify your password once.</Tip>
