## Description

To ensure secure storage of your login credentials when using the CLI, Infisical saves them to a password manager if one is detected. 
If a password manager is not available, your credentials are stored in an encrypted text file. 


<Accordion title="Supported password managers" defaultOpen="true">
  By default, the most appropriate password manager is chosen to store your login credentials. 
  For example, if you are on macOS, KeyChain will be automatically selected.

- [macOS Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/keychain-access/welcome/mac)
- [Windows Credential Manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager)
- Secret Service ([Gnome Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring), [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5))
- [KWallet](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.kwalletmanager5)
- [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
- [KeyCtl]()

<Tip>To avoid constantly entering your passphrase when using the `file` vault type, set the `INFISICAL_VAULT_FILE_PASSPHRASE` environment variable with your password in your shell</Tip>
