## Description

This command enables you to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on secrets within your Infisical project. With it, you can view, create, update, and delete secrets in your environment.

### Sub-commands

  Use this command to print out all of the secrets in your project

```bash
$ infisical secrets
```

### Environment variables

  <Accordion title="INFISICAL_TOKEN">
    Used to fetch secrets via a [service token](/documentation/platform/token) apposed to logged in credentials. Simply, export this variable in the terminal before running this command.

    ```bash
    # Example

    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="INFISICAL_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK">
    Used to disable the check for new CLI versions. This can improve the time it takes to run this command. Recommended for production environments.
    
    To use, simply export this variable in the terminal before running this command.
