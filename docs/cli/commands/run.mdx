  ### Environment variables
  <Accordion title="INFISICAL_TOKEN">
    Used to fetch secrets via a [service token](/documentation/platform/token) apposed to logged in credentials. Simply, export this variable in the terminal before running this command.

    ```bash
    # Example 
    export INFISICAL_TOKEN=st.63e03c4a97cb4a747186c71e.ed5b46a34c078a8f94e8228f4ab0ff97.4f7f38034811995997d72badf44b42ec
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="INFISICAL_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK">
    Used to disable the check for new CLI versions. This can improve the time it takes to run this command. Recommended for production environments.
    
    To use, simply export this variable in the terminal before running this command.

    ```bash
    # Example 
    export INFISICAL_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=true
    ```
  </Accordion>

  ### Flags 
  
   <Accordion title="--project-config-dir">
    Explicitly set the directory where the .infisical.json resides. This is useful for some monorepo setups. 

    ```bash
    # Example 
    infisical run --project-config-dir=/some-dir -- printenv
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="--command">
    Pass secrets into multiple commands at once

    ```bash
    # Example 
    infisical run --command="npm run build && npm run dev; more-commands..."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="--token">
    If you are using a [service token](/documentation/platform/token) to authenticate, you can pass the token as a flag

    ```bash
    # Example 
    infisical run --token="st.63e03c4a97cb4a747186c71e.ed5b46a34c078a8f94e8228f4ab0ff97.4f7f38034811995997d72badf44b42ec" -- npm run start
    ```

    You may also expose the token to the CLI by setting the environment variable `INFISICAL_TOKEN` before executing the run command. This will have the same effect as setting the token with `--token` flag 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="--expand">
    Turn on or off the shell parameter expansion in your secrets. If you have used shell parameters in your secret(s), activating this feature will populate them before injecting them into your application process.

    Default value: `true`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="--env">
    This is used to specify the environment from which secrets should be retrieved. The accepted values are the environment slugs defined for your project, such as `dev`, `staging`, `test`, and `prod`.

    ```bash
    # Example 
    infisical run --tags=tag1,tag2,tag3 -- npm run dev
    ```

    Note: you must reference the tag by its slug name not its fully qualified name. Go to project settings to view all tag slugs.

    By default, all secrets are fetched
  </Accordion>

    ```bash

    infisical run --path="/nextjs" -- npm run dev
