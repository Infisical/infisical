The Infisical CLI is a powerful command line tool that can be used to retrieve, modify, export and inject secrets into any process or application as environment variables. 
You can use it across various environments, whether it's local development, CI/CD, staging, or production.

## Install a Specific Version

In production or CI environments, itâ€™s best to **pin the Infisical CLI to a specific version** to avoid unexpected updates.  
Below are the common methods to do so:

### npm (cross-platform)
```bash
# Replace <version> with the desired release
npm install -g @infisical/cli@<version>
infisical --version
```

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
> Homebrew keeps only the latest formula. To install a specific version, extract and install from a local tap:
```bash
brew tap-new $USER/local
brew extract --version <version> infisical $USER/local
brew install $USER/local/infisical@<version>
infisical --version
```

### Direct Binary (GitHub Releases)
> Download the tarball for your OS/architecture from [Infisical CLI Releases](https://github.com/Infisical/cli/releases)
```bash
# Example (macOS arm64)
curl -L -o infisical.tar.gz   https://github.com/Infisical/cli/releases/download/v<version>/infisical_<version>_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf infisical.tar.gz
sudo mv infisical /usr/local/bin/
infisical --version
```

> ðŸ’¡ For CI/CD pipelines, always pin a fixed version and update it manually through PRs or release workflows.
