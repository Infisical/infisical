Prerequisite: [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Authenticate
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local development">
    To use the Infisical CLI in your development environment, you can run the command below.
    This will allow you to access the features and functionality provided by the CLI.

    ```bash 
    infisical login 
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Infisical Token">
    To use Infisical CLI in environments where you cannot run the `infisical login` command, you can authenticate via a
    Infisical Token instead. Learn more about [Infisical Token](/documentation/platform/token).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Initialize Infisical for your project

```bash
# navigate to your project
cd /path/to/project

# initialize infisical
infisical init
```

## Inject environment variables

```bash
# inject environment variables into app
infisical run -- [your application start command]
```

<Accordion title="Injecting environment variables in custom aliases">
  Custom aliases can utilize secrets from Infisical. Suppose there is a custom alias `yd` in `custom.sh` that runs `yarn dev` and needs the secrets provided by Infisical.
  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh

  yd() {
    yarn dev
  }
  ```

  To make the secrets available from Infisical to `yd`, you can run the following command:

  ```bash
  infisical run --command="source custom.sh && yd"
  ```

  View all available options for `run` command [here](./commands/run)
</Accordion>


## Examples:

```bash
# example with node
infisical run -- node index.js

# example with node (nodemon)
infisical run -- nodemon index.js

# example with node (nodemon) pulling in secrets from test environment
infisical run --env=test -- nodemon index.js

# example with flask
