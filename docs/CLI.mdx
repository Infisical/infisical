## Background

Infisical ships with multiple commands to assist with ongoing project needs; we list these commands and give context for them below.

For details on the security of our platform, check out our security brief.

Note on arguments:

- [environment]: the intended environment for the given command being one of dev, staging, or prod.
- [projectId]: the project identifier found on the dashboard.

## Commands

### Log in

The command prompts the user to login and enter their credentials to be authenticated with the SRP protocol. If successful, the user receives a JWT token, their public key, and their (encrypted) private key back to be stored on their local machine.

```jsx
npx infisical login
```

### Connect to a project

The command connects the local codebase to a project with id [projectId] on the remote server to be set as the reference project for future potential push/pull operations. It validates the user's membership for the given project, creates a new .env.infisical file in the project, and writes the id to it. It is commonly used for two scenarios:

- To establish a fresh connection with a project.
- To change an existing connection to a new project. 

```jsx
npx infisical connect [projectId]
```

### Pull environment variables to local

The command pulls the latest encrypted key-value pairs (i.e. environment variables) and symmetric key from the remote server, decrypts the symmetric key with the user's local private key, decrypts the environment variables with that symmetric key, and overwrites the local .env file with the new environment variables.

If no .env file exists, the command creates a new .env file and populates it with the new environment variables.

```jsx
npx infisical pull [environment]
```

### Push environment variables to remote server

The command parses the local .env file into key-value pairs (i.e. environment variables), generates a random symmetric key, encrypts the environment variables with that symmetric key, gets the public keys of project members, creates multiple encrypted symmetric keys under each teammate's public key, and sends the encrypted environment variables and symmetric keys off to the remote server.

If there is an existing (encrypted) symmetric key being shared for the project, then it fetches and uses that symmetric key to encrypt the environment variables.

```jsx
npx infisical push [environment]
```
