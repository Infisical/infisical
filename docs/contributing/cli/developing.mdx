## Golang installation

Our CLI is written in Go. You'll need to install it and know the basics if you want to interact with it. If you're not yet familiar with Go, here's a [guide](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started)

1. Install `go` (https://go.dev/doc/install)

<Note>
	Note that the below installation methods may not always provide the latest
	version. But it's easier to get started with `go` that way
</Note>

### brew

```sh
# install `go` using brew
brew install go
go version
```

### deb

```sh
# install `go` using apt
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y golang
go version
```

### snap

```sh
# install `go` using snap
sudo snap install go --classic
go version
```

### choco (powershell)

```sh
# install `go` using choco
choco install golang
go version
```

## Local setup

1. Go to the `cli/` subfolder
2. Build the binary to see if everything works as expected
   1. `go build`
3. If you don't see any error message, then you're ready to `go` :)
4. To test the local CLI : `go run . <sub-command> <options>`
   1. If your IDE supports it, you can also take advantage over the debugging and building functionalities
      1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)
      2. [JetBrains Suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

<Warning>
	To work with a self-hosted infisical instance, you'll have to follow this
	guide first and then configure the environment variable `INFISICAL_API_URL` to
	your localhost (e.g. `INFISICAL_API_URL=http://localhost/api`)
</Warning>
