description: "Contributing to the Infisical ecosystem."

To set a strong foundation, this section outlines how we, the community and members of Infisical,
should approach the development and contribution process.

## Code-bases
Infisical has two major code-bases. One for the platform code, and one for SDKs. The contribution process has some key differences between the two, so we've split the documentation into two sections:

- The [Infisical Platform](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), the Infisical platform itself.
- The [Infisical SDKs (local development guide)](/contributing/sdks/developing), for contributing to the official client SDKs.

    The SDKs are the official Infisical client libraries, used by developers to easily interact with and contribute to the Infisical platform.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Community

We are building an inclusive community, and this means adhering to the [Code of Conduct](/contributing/getting-started/code-of-conduct).

## Bugs and issues

Bug reports help make Infisical a better experience for everyone. When you report a bug, a template will be created automatically containing information we'd like to know.

Before raising a new issue, please search existing ones to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

<Info>
  If the issue is related to security, please email us directly at
  team@infisical.com.

## Deciding what to work on

You can start by browsing through our list of issues or adding your own that improves on the platform experience. Once you've decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approved; this helps avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

If you're ever in doubt about whether or not a proposed feature aligns with Infisical as a whole, feel free to raise an issue about it and we'll get back to you promptly.

## Writing and submitting code

Anyone can contribute code to Infisical. To get started, check out the local development guides for each language.

- Local development guide for SDKs is [here](/contributing/sdks/developing).

## Licensing

Most of Infisical's code is under the MIT license, though some paid feature restrictions are covered by a proprietary license.

Any third party components incorporated into our code are licensed under the original license provided by the applicable component owner.
