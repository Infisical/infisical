## Fork and clone the repo

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [repository](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical) to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it to your local device.

Once, you've done that, create a new branch:

```console
git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
```

## Set up environment variables

Start by creating a .env file at the root of the Infisical directory then copy the contents of the file linked [here](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/blob/main/.env.example). View all available [environment variables](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/envars) and guidance for each.

## Starting Infisical for development

We use Docker to spin up all required services for Infisical in local development. If you are unfamiliar with Docker, donâ€™t worry, all you have to do is install Docker for your
machine and run the command below to start up the development server.

#### Start local server

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

#### Access local server

Once all the services have spun up, browse to http://localhost:8080.

#### Shutdown local server

```bash
# To stop environment use Control+C (on Mac) CTRL+C (on Win) or
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## Starting Infisical docs locally

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for our docs.

#### Install Mint CLI.

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

or

```bash
yarn global add mint
```

#### Running the docs

Go to `docs` directory and run `mint dev`. This will start up the docs on `localhost:3000`

```bash
# From the root directory
cd docs; mint dev;
```
