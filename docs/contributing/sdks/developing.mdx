Developing Infisical SDKs Locally

This guide explains how to **clone, run, test, and contribute** to Infisical SDKs across supported languages.

> This page is for **contributors** who want to work on the SDKs themselves.  
> To **use** SDKs in your app, check out the official [Infisical SDK documentation](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/overview).


## Repositories

Pick your target SDK and follow its repository’s CONTRIBUTING guide:

- **Node.js** — https://github.com/Infisical/node-sdk-v2
- **Python** —  https://github.com/Infisical/python-sdk-official
- **Go** —  https://github.com/Infisical/go-sdk
- **Java** — https://github.com/Infisical/java-sdk
- **rust** — https://github.com/Infisical/rust-sdk 
- **C++** — https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-cpp-sdk
- **PHP** — https://github.com/Infisical/php-sdk


> Each SDK repository documents language-specific local setup, testing, and release steps.

## Prerequisites

- Git + a GitHub account.
- The language toolchain for your SDK (Node.js LTS, Python 3.x, Go toolchain, JDK, .NET SDK, etc.).
- Any SDK-specific tools listed in that repository’s README/CONTRIBUTING.

## Recommended workflow

1. **Fork** the SDK repository and **clone** it locally.  
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-desc>
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (language-specific).  
4. **Run tests** locally to validate your setup.  
5. Implement changes; add/adjust tests as needed.  
6. **Lint/format** per repo guidelines (ESLint/Prettier, Black/Flake8, gofmt, rustfmt, etc.).  
7. **Commit & push**, then open a PR to the SDK repository with a clear summary and rationale.

## Common commands (examples)

### Node / TypeScript
```
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

### Python
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

### Go
```
go test ./...
```

### Java (Gradle)
```
./gradlew build test
```

> See the specific SDK repo’s CONTRIBUTING for authoritative commands.

## Code style & CI
Follow each SDK repo’s style and CI rules. Keep PRs focused and include test results or screenshots where helpful.

## Need help?
- Ask in the SDK repo’s issues/discussions.
- Or open a docs issue on the main Infisical repo to improve this guide.
