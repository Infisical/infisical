Secret Syncs enable you to sync secrets from Infisical to third-party services using [App Connections](/integrations/app-connections/overview).

<Note>
    Secret Syncs will gradually replace Native Integrations as they become available. Native Integrations will be deprecated in the future, so opt for configuring a Secret Sync when available.
</Note>

## Concept

Secret Syncs are a project-level resource used to sync secrets, via an [App Connection](/integrations/app-connections/overview), from a particular project environment and folder path (source)
to a third-party service (destination). Changes to the source will automatically be propagated to the destination, ensuring
your secrets are always up-to-date.

## Workflow

Configuring a Secret Sync requires three components: a <strong>source</strong> location to retrieve secrets from,
a <strong>destination</strong> endpoint to deploy secrets to, and <strong>configuration options</strong> to determine how your secrets
should be synced. Follow these steps to start syncing:

<Note>
    For step-by-step guides on syncing to a particular third-party service, refer to the Secret Syncs section in the Navigation Bar.
</Note>

1. <strong>Create App Connection:</strong> If you have not already done so, create an [App Connection](/integrations/app-connections/overview)
via the UI or API for the third-party service you intend to sync secrets to.

2. <strong>Create Secret Sync:</strong> Configure a Secret Sync in the desired project by specifying the following parameters via the UI or API:
    - <strong>Source:</strong> The project environment and folder path you wish to retrieve secrets from.
    - <strong>Destination:</strong> The App Connection to utilize and the destination endpoint to deploy secrets to. These can vary between services.
    - <strong>Options:</strong> Customize how secrets should be synced. Examples include adding a suffix or prefix to your secrets, or importing secrets from the destination on the initial sync.

<Info>
    Some third-party services do not support importing secrets.
</Info>

3. <strong>Utilize Sync:</strong> Any changes to the source location will now automatically be propagated to the destination endpoint.

<Note>
    Infisical is continuously expanding it's Secret Sync third-party service support. If the service you need isn't available,
    you can still use our Native Integrations in the interim, or contact us at team@infisical.com to make a request .
