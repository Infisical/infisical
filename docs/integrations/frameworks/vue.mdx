- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Vue](https://vuejs.org) app

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

infisical init
```

## Start your application as usual but with Infisical

```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have

  [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html).
