description: "How to use Infisical to inject environment variables and secrets into terraform."

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) project

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize Infisical
infisical init
```

## Run terraform as usual but with Infisical

```bash
infisical run -- <your application start command>

# Example
infisical run -- terraform plan
```

<Note>
  To inject any arbitrary variable to terraform, you have
  to prefix them with `TF_VAR`. Read more about that
  [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/environment-variables#tf_var_name).
