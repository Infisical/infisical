This guide provides step-by-step guidance on how to fetch secrets from Infisical using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Terraform
- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Steps

### 1. Define Required Providers

Specify `infisical` in the `required_providers` block within the `terraform` block of your configuration file. If you would like to use a specific version of the provider, uncomment and replace `<latest version>` with the version of the Infisical provider that you want to use.

```hcl main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    infisical = {
      # version = <latest version>
      source = "infisical/infisical"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Configure the Infisical Provider

Set up the Infisical provider by specifying the `host` and `service_token`. Replace `<>` in `service_token` with your actual token. The `host` is only required if you are using a self-hosted instance of Infisical.

```hcl main.tf
provider "infisical" {
  host          = "https://app.infisical.com" # Only required if using a self-hosted instance of Infisical, default is https://app.infisical.com
  client_id     = "<>"
  client_secret = "<>"
  service_token = "<>" # DEPRECATED, USE MACHINE IDENTITY AUTH INSTEAD
}
```

<Warning>
  It is recommended to use Terraform variables to pass your service token dynamically to avoid hard coding it
</Warning>

### 3. Fetch Infisical Secrets

Use the `infisical_secrets` data source to fetch your secrets. In this block, you must set the `env_slug` and `folder_path` to scope the secrets you want. 

`env_slug` is the slug of the environment name. This slug name can be found under the project settings page on the Infisical dashboard. 

`folder_path` is the path to the folder in a given environment. The path `/` for root of the environment where as `/folder1` is the folder at the root of the environment.

```hcl main.tf
data "infisical_secrets" "my-secrets" {
  env_slug    = "dev"
  folder_path = "/some-folder/another-folder"
  workspace_id = "your-project-id"
}
```

### 4. Define Outputs

As an example, we are going to output your fetched secrets. Replace `SECRET-NAME` with the actual name of your secret.

For a single secret:

```hcl main.tf
output "single-secret" {
  value = data.infisical_secrets.my-secrets.secrets["SECRET-NAME"]
}
```

For all secrets:

```hcl
output "all-secrets" {
  value = data.infisical_secrets.my-secrets.secrets
}
```

### 5. Run Terraform

Once your configuration is complete, initialize your Terraform working directory:

```bash
$ terraform init
```

Then, run the plan command to view the fetched secrets:

```bash
$ terraform plan
```

Terraform will now fetch your secrets from Infisical and display them as output according to your configuration.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up and used the Infisical provider with Terraform to fetch secrets. For more information, visit the [Infisical documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Infisical/infisical/latest/docs). */}
