Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Bun](https://bun.sh)

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize infisical
infisical init
```

## Start your application as usual but with Infisical

```

<Info>
  Bun environment variables can be called as either `Bun.env.SECRET` or `process.env.SECRET`. We also recommend you check this more in-depth [guide to environment variables in Bun](https://infisical.com/blog/bun-environment-variables).
