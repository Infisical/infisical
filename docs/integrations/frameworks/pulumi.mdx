description: "Using Infisical with Pulumi via the Terraform Bridge"
---

Infisical can be integrated with Pulumi by leveraging Pulumi’s [Terraform Bridge](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/any-terraform-provider/), 
which allows Terraform providers to be used seamlessly within Pulumi projects. This enables infrastructure and platform teams to manage Infisical secrets and resources 
using Pulumi’s familiar programming languages (including TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#), without any change to existing workflows.

The Terraform Bridge wraps the [Infisical Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Infisical/infisical/latest/docs) and exposes its resources (such as `infisical_secret`, `infisical_project`, and `infisical_service_token`) 
in a Pulumi-compatible interface. This makes it easy to integrate secret management directly into Pulumi-based IaC pipelines, ensuring secrets stay in sync with 
the rest of your cloud infrastructure. Authentication is handled through the same methods as Terraform: using environment variables such as `INFISICAL_TOKEN` and `INFISICAL_SITE_URL`.

By bridging the Infisical provider, teams using Pulumi can adopt secure, centralized secrets management without compromising on their toolchain or language preferences.
