## Overview

The **InfisicalPushSecret** CRD allows you to create secrets in your Kubernetes cluster and push them to Infisical.


This CRD offers the following features:
- **Push Secrets** from a Kubernetes secret into Infisical.
- **Manage secret lifecycle** of pushed secrets in Infisical. When the Kubernetes secret is updated, the operator will automatically update the secrets in Infisical. Optionally, when the Kubernetes secret is deleted, the operator will delete the secrets in Infisical automatically.

### Prerequisites

- A project within Infisical.
- A [machine identity](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) ready for use in Infisical that has permissions to create secrets in your project.
- The operator is installed on to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Example usage

Below is a sample InfisicalPushSecret CRD that pushes secrets defined in a Kubernetes secret to Infisical.

After filling out the fields in the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you can apply it directly to your cluster.

Before applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the secrets you want to push to Infisical. An example can be seen below the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

```yaml infisical-push-secret.yaml
  apiVersion: secrets.infisical.com/v1alpha1
  kind: InfisicalPushSecret
  metadata:
    name: infisical-push-secret-demo
  spec:
    resyncInterval: 1m # Remove this field to disable automatic reconciliation of the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.
    hostAPI: https://app.infisical.com/api

    # Optional, defaults to no replacement.
    updatePolicy: Replace # If set to replace, existing secrets inside Infisical will be replaced by the value of the PushSecret on sync.

    # Optional, defaults to no deletion.
    deletionPolicy: Delete # If set to delete, the secret(s) inside Infisical managed by the operator, will be deleted if the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

    destination:
      projectId: <project-id> # Either projectId or projectSlug is required
      projectSlug: <project-slug>
      environmentSlug: <env-slug>
      secretsPath: <secret-path>

    push:
      secret:
        secretName: push-secret-demo # Secret CRD
        secretNamespace: default

    # Only have one authentication method defined or you are likely to run into authentication issues.
    # Remove all except one authentication method.
    authentication:
      awsIamAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      azureAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      gcpIamAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
        serviceAccountKeyFilePath: </path-to-service-account-key-file.json>
      gcpIdTokenAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      kubernetesAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
        serviceAccountRef:
          name: <secret-name>
          namespace: <secret-namespace>
      ldapAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
        credentialsRef:
          secretName: <secret-name> # ldap-auth-credentials
          secretNamespace: <secret-namespace> # default
      universalAuth:
        credentialsRef:
          secretName: <secret-name> # universal-auth-credentials
          secretNamespace: <secret-namespace> # default
```

```yaml source-secret.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: push-secret-demo
    namespace: default
  stringData: # can also be "data", but needs to be base64 encoded
    API_KEY: some-api-key
    DATABASE_URL: postgres://127.0.0.1:5432
    ENCRYPTION_KEY: fabcc12-a22-facbaa4-11aa568aab
```

```bash
  kubectl apply -f source-secret.yaml
```

After applying the soruce-secret.yaml file, you are ready to apply the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

```bash
  kubectl apply -f infisical-push-secret.yaml
```

After applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you should notice that the secrets you have defined in your source-secret.yaml file have been pushed to your specified destination in Infisical.


## InfisicalPushSecret CRD properties

<Accordion title="hostAPI">
  If you are fetching secrets from a self-hosted instance of Infisical set the value of `hostAPI` to
  `https://your-self-hosted-instace.com/api`

  When `hostAPI` is not defined the operator fetches secrets from Infisical Cloud.

  <Accordion title="Advanced use case">
    If you have installed your Infisical instance within the same cluster as the Infisical operator, you can optionally access the Infisical backend's service directly without having to route through the public internet.
    To achieve this, use the following address for the hostAPI field:

    ``` bash
    http://<backend-svc-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:4000/api
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<backend-svc-name>` and `<namespace>` with the appropriate values for your backend service and namespace.

  </Accordion>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="resyncInterval">

  The `resyncInterval` is a string-formatted duration that defines the time between each resync. The field is optional, and will default to no automatic resync if not defined.

  If you don't want to automatically reconcile the InfisicalPushSecret CRD on an interval, you can remove the `resyncInterval` field entirely from your InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

  The format of the field is `[duration][unit]` where `duration` is a number and `unit` is a string representing the unit of time.

  The following units are supported:
  - `s` for seconds (must be at least 5 seconds)
  - `m` for minutes
  - `h` for hours
  - `d` for days
  - `w` for weeks

  The default value is `1m` (1 minute).

  Valid intervals examples:
  ```yaml
  resyncInterval: 5s # 10 seconds
  resyncInterval: 10s # 10 seconds
  resyncInterval: 5m # 5 minutes
  resyncInterval: 1h # 1 hour
  resyncInterval: 1d # 1 day
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="updatePolicy">

  The field is optional and will default to `None` if not defined.

  The update policy defines how the operator should handle conflicting secrets when pushing secrets to Infisical.

  Valid values are `None` and `Replace`.

  Behavior of each policy:
  - `None`: The operator will not override existing secrets in Infisical. If a secret with the same key already exists, the operator will skip pushing that secret, and the secret will not be managed by the operator.
  - `Replace`: The operator will replace existing secrets in Infisical with the new secrets. If a secret with the same key already exists, the operator will update the secret with the new value.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    updatePolicy: Replace
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="deletionPolicy">

  This field is optional and will default to `None` if not defined.

  The deletion policy defines what the operator should do in case the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

  Valid values are `None` and `Delete`.

  Behavior of each policy:
  - `None`: The operator will not delete the secrets in Infisical when the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.
  - `Delete`: The operator will delete the secrets in Infisical that are managed by the operator when the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    deletionPolicy: Delete
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="destination">
  The `destination` field is used to specify where you want to create the secrets in Infisical. The required fields are `projectId`, `environmentSlug`, and `secretsPath`.

## Using templating to push secrets

Pushing secrets to Infisical from the operator may not always be enough.
Templating is a useful utility of the Infisical secrets operator that allows you to use Go Templating to template the secrets you want to push to Infisical.
Using Go templates, you can format, combine, and create new key-value pairs of secrets that you want to push to Infisical.

<Accordion title="push.secret.template"/>
<Accordion title="push.secret.template.includeAllSecrets">
  This property controls what secrets are included in your push to Infisica.
  When set to `true`, all secrets included in the `push.secret.secretName` Kubernetes secret will be pushed to Infisical.
  **Use this option when you would like to push all secrets to Infisical from the secrets operator, but want to template a subset of them.**

  When set to `false`, only secrets defined in the `push.secret.template.data` field of the template will be pushed to Infisical.
  Use this option when you would like to push **only** a subset of secrets from the Kubernetes secret to Infisical.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="push.secret.template.data">
  Define secret keys and their corresponding templates.
  Each data value uses a Golang template with access to all secrets defined in the `push.secret.secretName` Kubernetes secret.

  Secrets are structured as follows:

  ```go
  type TemplateSecret struct {
      Value      string `json:"value"`
      SecretPath string `json:"secretPath"`
  }
  ```

  #### Example template configuration:

  ```yaml
  # This example assumes that the `push-secret-demo` Kubernetes secret contains the following secrets:
  # SITE_URL = "https://example.com"
  # REGION = "us-east-1"
  # OTHER_SECRET = "other-secret"

  push:
    secret:
      secretName: push-secret-demo
      secretNamespace: default
      template:
        includeAllSecrets: true # Includes all secrets from the `push-secret-demo` Kubernetes secret
        data:
          SITE_URL: "{{ .SITE_URL.Value }}"
          API_URL: "https://api.{{.SITE_URL.Value}}.{{.REGION.Value}}.com" # Will create a new secret in Infisical with the key `API_URL` with the value of the `SITE_URL` and `REGION` secrets
  ```

  To help transform your config map data further, the operator provides a set of built-in functions that you can use in your templates.

  ### Available templating functions
  Please refer to the [templating functions documentation](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes/overview#available-helper-functions) for more information.
</Accordion>

## Using generators to push secrets

Generators allow secrets to be dynamically generated during each reconciliation cycle and then pushed to Infisical. They are useful for use cases where a new secret value is needed on every sync, such as ephemeral credentials or one-time-use tokens.

A generator is defined as a custom resource (`ClusterGenerator`) within the cluster, which specifies the logic for generating secret values. Generators are stateless, each invocation triggers the creation of a new set of values, with no tracking or persistence of previously generated data.

Because of this behavior, you may want to disable automatic syncing for the `InfisicalPushSecret` resource to avoid continuous regeneration of secrets. This can be done by omitting the `resyncInterval` field from the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

### Example usage
```yaml
  push:
    secret:
      secretName: push-secret-source-secret
      secretNamespace: dev
    generators:
      - destinationSecretName: password-generator # Name of the secret that will be created in Infisical
        generatorRef:
          kind: Password # Kind of the resource, must match the generator kind.
          name: custom-generator # Name of the generator resource
```

To use a generator, you must specify at least one generator in the `push.generators[]` field.


<Accordion title="push.generators[]">
  This field holds an array of the generators you want to use for your InfisicalPushSecret CRD.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="push.generators[].destinationSecretName">
  The name of the secret that will be created in Infisical.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="push.generators[].generatorRef">
  The reference to the generator resource.

  Valid fields:
  - `kind`: The kind of the generator resource, must match the generator kind.
  - `name`: The name of the generator resource.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="push.generators[].generatorRef.kind">
  The kind of the generator resource, must match the generator kind.

  Valid values:
  - `Password`
  - `UUID`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="push.generators[].generatorRef.name">
  The name of the generator resource.
</Accordion>

### Supported Generators
Below are the currently supported generators for the InfisicalPushSecret CRD. Each generator is a `ClusterGenerator` custom resource that can be used to customize the generated secret.

<Accordion title="Password Generator">
  ### Password Generator

  The Password generator is a custom resource that is installed on the cluster that defines the logic for generating a password.
    - `kind`: The kind of the generator resource, must match the generator kind. For the Password generator, the kind is `Password`.
    - `generator.passwordSpec`: The spec of the password generator.

    <Accordion title="generator.kind">

    - `digits`: The number of digits in the password.
    - `symbols`: The number of symbols in the password.
    - `symbolCharacters`: The characters to use for the symbols in the password.
    - `noUpper`: Whether to include uppercase letters in the password.
    - `allowRepeat`: Whether to allow repeating characters in the password.
    </Accordion>

  ```yaml password-cluster-generator.yaml
  apiVersion: secrets.infisical.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ClusterGenerator

            name: uuid-generator
  ```
</Accordion>




## Applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD to your cluster

Once you have configured the `InfisicalPushSecret` CRD with the required fields, you can apply it to your cluster.
After applying, you should notice that the secrets have been pushed to Infisical.

```bash
  kubectl apply -f source-push-secret.yaml # The secret that you're referencing in the InfisicalPushSecret CRD push.secret field
  kubectl apply -f example-infisical-push-secret-crd.yaml # The InfisicalPushSecret CRD itself
```
