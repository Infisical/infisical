## Overview 

The **InfisicalPushSecret** CRD allows you to create secrets in your Kubernetes cluster and push them to Infisical. 


This CRD offers the following features:
- **Push Secrets** from a Kubernetes secret into Infisical.
- **Manage secret lifecycle** of pushed secrets in Infisical. When the Kubernetes secret is updated, the operator will automatically update the secrets in Infisical. Optionally, when the Kubernetes secret is deleted, the operator will delete the secrets in Infisical automatically.

### Prerequisites

- A project within Infisical.
- A [machine identity](/docs/documentation/platform/identities/overview) ready for use in Infisical that has permissions to create secrets in your project.
- The operator is installed on to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Example usage

Below is a sample InfisicalPushSecret CRD that pushes secrets defined in a Kubernetes secret to Infisical.

After filling out the fields in the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you can apply it directly to your cluster.

Before applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the secrets you want to push to Infisical. An example can be seen below the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

```yaml infisical-push-secret.yaml
  apiVersion: secrets.infisical.com/v1alpha1
  kind: InfisicalPushSecret
  metadata:
    name: infisical-push-secret-demo
  spec:
    resyncInterval: 1m
    hostAPI: https://app.infisical.com/api

    # Optional, defaults to no replacement.
    updatePolicy: Replace # If set to replace, existing secrets inside Infisical will be replaced by the value of the PushSecret on sync.

    # Optional, defaults to no deletion.
    deletionPolicy: Delete # If set to delete, the secret(s) inside Infisical managed by the operator, will be deleted if the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

    destination:
      projectId: <project-id>
      environmentSlug: <env-slug>
      secretsPath: <secret-path>

    push:
      secret:
        secretName: push-secret-demo # Secret CRD
        secretNamespace: default

    # Only have one authentication method defined or you are likely to run into authentication issues.
    # Remove all except one authentication method.
    authentication:
      awsIamAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      azureAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      gcpIamAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
        serviceAccountKeyFilePath: </path-to-service-account-key-file.json>
      gcpIdTokenAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      kubernetesAuth:
        identityId: <machine-identity-id>
        serviceAccountRef:
          name: <secret-name>
          namespace: <secret-namespace>
      universalAuth:
        credentialsRef:
          secretName: <secret-name> # universal-auth-credentials
          secretNamespace: <secret-namespace> # default
```

```yaml source-secret.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: push-secret-demo
    namespace: default
  stringData: # can also be "data", but needs to be base64 encoded
    API_KEY: some-api-key
    DATABASE_URL: postgres://127.0.0.1:5432
    ENCRYPTION_KEY: fabcc12-a22-facbaa4-11aa568aab
```

```bash
  kubectl apply -f source-secret.yaml
```

After applying the soruce-secret.yaml file, you are ready to apply the InfisicalPushSecret CRD.

```bash
  kubectl apply -f infisical-push-secret.yaml
```

After applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD, you should notice that the secrets you have defined in your source-secret.yaml file have been pushed to your specified destination in Infisical.


## InfisicalPushSecret CRD properties

<Accordion title="hostAPI">
  If you are fetching secrets from a self-hosted instance of Infisical set the value of `hostAPI` to 
  ` https://your-self-hosted-instace.com/api`

  When `hostAPI` is not defined the operator fetches secrets from Infisical Cloud.

  <Accordion title="Advanced use case">
    If you have installed your Infisical instance within the same cluster as the Infisical operator, you can optionally access the Infisical backend's service directly without having to route through the public internet. 
    To achieve this, use the following address for the hostAPI field:
    
    ``` bash
    http://<backend-svc-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:4000/api
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<backend-svc-name>` and `<namespace>` with the appropriate values for your backend service and namespace.

  </Accordion>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="resyncInterval">

  The `resyncInterval` is a string-formatted duration that defines the time between each resync.

  The format of the field is `[duration][unit]` where `duration` is a number and `unit` is a string representing the unit of time.

  The following units are supported:
  - `s` for seconds (must be at least 5 seconds)
  - `m` for minutes
  - `h` for hours
  - `d` for days
  - `w` for weeks

  The default value is `1m` (1 minute).

  Valid intervals examples:
  ```yaml
  resyncInterval: 5s # 10 seconds
  resyncInterval: 10s # 10 seconds
  resyncInterval: 5m # 5 minutes
  resyncInterval: 1h # 1 hour
  resyncInterval: 1d # 1 day
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="updatePolicy">

  The field is optional and will default to `None` if not defined.

  The update policy defines how the operator should handle conflicting secrets when pushing secrets to Infisical.

  Valid values are `None` and `Replace`.

  Behavior of each policy:
  - `None`: The operator will not override existing secrets in Infisical. If a secret with the same key already exists, the operator will skip pushing that secret, and the secret will not be managed by the operator.
  - `Replace`: The operator will replace existing secrets in Infisical with the new secrets. If a secret with the same key already exists, the operator will update the secret with the new value.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    updatePolicy: Replace
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="deletionPolicy">

  This field is optional and will default to `None` if not defined.

  The deletion policy defines what the operator should do in case the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

  Valid values are `None` and `Delete`.

  Behavior of each policy:
  - `None`: The operator will not delete the secrets in Infisical when the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.
  - `Delete`: The operator will delete the secrets in Infisical that are managed by the operator when the InfisicalPushSecret CRD is deleted.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    deletionPolicy: Delete
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="destination">
  The `destination` field is used to specify where you want to create the secrets in Infisical. The required fields are `projectId`, `environmentSlug`, and `secretsPath`.
  
  ```yaml
  spec:
    destination:
      projectId: <project-id>
      environmentSlug: <env-slug>
      secretsPath: <secrets-path>
  ```

  <Accordion title="destination.projectId">
    The project ID where you want to create the secrets in Infisical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="destination.environmentSlug">
    The environment slug where you want to create the secrets in Infisical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="destination.secretsPath">
    The path where you want to create the secrets in Infisical. The root path is `/`.
  </Accordion>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="push">
  The `push` field is used to define what you want to push to Infisical. Currently the operator only supports pushing Kubernetes secrets to Infisical. An example of the `push` field is shown below.
  


  <Accordion title="secret">
    The `secret` field is used to define the Kubernetes secret you want to push to Infisical. The required fields are `secretName` and `secretNamespace`.



    Example usage of the `push.secret` field:

## Applying the InfisicalPushSecret CRD to your cluster

Once you have configured the `InfisicalPushSecret` CRD with the required fields, you can apply it to your cluster.
After applying, you should notice that the secrets have been pushed to Infisical.

```bash
  kubectl apply -f source-push-secret.yaml # The secret that you're referencing in the InfisicalPushSecret CRD push.secret field
  kubectl apply -f example-infisical-push-secret-crd.yaml # The InfisicalPushSecret CRD itself
```
