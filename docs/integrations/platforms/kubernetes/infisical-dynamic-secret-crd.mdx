---

## Overview

The **InfisicalDynamicSecret** CRD allows you to easily create and manage dynamic secret leases in Infisical and automatically sync them to your Kubernetes cluster as native **Kubernetes Secret** resources.
This means any Pod, Deployment, or other Kubernetes resource can make use of dynamic secrets from Infisical just like any other K8s secret.

This CRD offers the following features:

- **Generate a dynamic secret lease** in Infisical and track its lifecycle.
- **Write** the dynamic secret from Infisical to your cluster as native Kubernetes secret.
- **Automatically rotate** the dynamic secret value before it expires to make sure your cluster always has valid credentials.
- **Optionally trigger redeployments** of any workloads that consume the secret if you enable auto-reload.

### Prerequisites

- A project within Infisical.
- A [machine identity](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) ready for use in Infisical that has permissions to create dynamic secret leases in the project.
- You have already configured a dynamic secret in Infisical.
- The operator is installed on to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Configure Dynamic Secret CRD

The example below shows a sample **InfisicalDynamicSecret** CRD that creates a dynamic secret lease in Infisical, and syncs the lease to your Kubernetes cluster.

```yaml dynamic-secret-crd.yaml
apiVersion: secrets.infisical.com/v1alpha1
kind: InfisicalDynamicSecret
metadata:
  name: infisicaldynamicsecret
spec:
  hostAPI: https://app.infisical.com/api # Optional, defaults to https://app.infisical.com/api

  dynamicSecret:
    secretName: <dynamic-secret-name>
    projectId: <project-id>
    secretsPath: <path/to/dynamic-secret> # Root directory is /
    environmentSlug: <env-slug>

  # Lease revocation policy defines what should happen to leases created by the operator if the CRD is deleted.
  # If set to "Revoke", leases will be revoked when the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD is deleted.
  leaseRevocationPolicy: Revoke

  # Lease TTL defines how long the lease should last for the dynamic secret.
  # This value must be less than 1 day, and if a max TTL is defined on the dynamic secret, it must be below the max TTL.
  leaseTTL: 1m

  # A reference to the secret that the dynamic secret lease should be stored in.
  # If the secret doesn't exist, it will automatically be created.
  managedSecretReference:
    secretName: <secret-name>
    secretNamespace: default # Must be the same namespace as the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD.
    creationPolicy: Orphan

  # Only have one authentication method defined or you are likely to run into authentication issues.
  # Remove all except one authentication method.
  authentication:
    awsIamAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
    azureAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
    gcpIamAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      serviceAccountKeyFilePath: </path-to-service-account-key-file.json>
    gcpIdTokenAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
    ldapAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      credentialsRef:
        secretName: <secret-name> # ldap-auth-credentials
        secretNamespace: <secret-namespace> # default
    kubernetesAuth:
      identityId: <machine-identity-id>
      serviceAccountRef:
        name: <secret-name>
        namespace: <secret-namespace>
    universalAuth:
      credentialsRef:
        secretName: <secret-name> # universal-auth-credentials
        secretNamespace: <secret-namespace> # default
```

Apply the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD to your cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f dynamic-secret-crd.yaml
```

After applying the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD, you should notice that the dynamic secret lease has been created in Infisical and synced to your Kubernetes cluster. You can verify that the lease has been created by doing:

```bash
kubectl get secret <managed-secret-name> -o yaml
```

After getting the secret, you should should see that the secret has data that contains the lease credentials.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: VHhETjZ4c2xsTXpOSWdPYW5LLlRyNEc2alVKYml6WiQjQS0tNTdodyREM3ZLZWtYSi4hTkdyS0F+TVFsLU9CSA==
  DB_USERNAME: cHg4Z0dJTUVBcHdtTW1aYnV3ZWRsekJRRll6cW4wFEE=
kind: Secret
# .....
```

### InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD properties

<Accordion title="hostAPI">
  If you are fetching secrets from a self-hosted instance of Infisical set the value of `hostAPI` to
  `https://your-self-hosted-instace.com/api`

When `hostAPI` is not defined the operator fetches secrets from Infisical Cloud.

  <Accordion title="Advanced use case">
    If you have installed your Infisical instance within the same cluster as the Infisical operator, you can optionally access the Infisical backend's service directly without having to route through the public internet.
    To achieve this, use the following address for the hostAPI field:

    ``` bash
    http://<backend-svc-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:4000/api
    ```

    Make sure to replace `<backend-svc-name>` and `<namespace>` with the appropriate values for your backend service and namespace.

  </Accordion>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="leaseTTL">
    The `leaseTTL` is a string-formatted duration that defines the time the lease should last for the dynamic secret.

The format of the field is `[duration][unit]` where `duration` is a number and `unit` is a string representing the unit of time.

The following units are supported:

- `s` for seconds (must be at least 5 seconds)
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours
- `d` for days

      <Note>
      The lease duration at most be 1 day (24 hours). And the TTL must be less than the max TTL defined on the dynamic secret.

    </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="managedSecretReference">
  The `managedSecretReference` field is used to define the Kubernetes secret where the dynamic secret lease should be stored. The required fields are `secretName` and `secretNamespace`.

```yaml
spec:
  managedSecretReference:
    secretName: <secret-name>
    secretNamespace: default
```

{" "}

<Accordion title="managedSecretReference.secretName">
  The name of the Kubernetes secret where the dynamic secret lease should be
  stored.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="managedSecretReference.secretNamespace">
  The namespace of the Kubernetes secret where the dynamic secret lease should
  be stored.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="managedSecretReference.creationPolicy">
    Creation policies allow you to control whether or not owner references should be added to the managed Kubernetes secret that is generated by the Infisical operator.
    This is useful for tools such as ArgoCD, where every resource requires an owner reference; otherwise, it will be pruned automatically.

    #### Available options
    - `Orphan` (default)
    - `Owner`

    <Tip>
      When creation policy is set to `Owner`, the `InfisicalSecret` CRD must be in
      the same namespace as where the managed kubernetes secret.
    </Tip>

    This field is optional.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="managedSecretReference.secretType">
    Override the default Opaque type for managed secrets with this field. Useful for creating kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson secrets.

    This field is optional.

  </Accordion>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="leaseRevocationPolicy">

The field is optional and will default to `None` if not defined.

The lease revocation policy defines what the operator should do with the leases created by the operator, when the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD is deleted.

Valid values are `None` and `Revoke`.

Behavior of each policy:

- `None`: The operator will not override existing secrets in Infisical. If a secret with the same key already exists, the operator will skip pushing that secret, and the secret will not be managed by the operator.
- `Revoke`: The operator will revoke the leases created by the operator when the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD is deleted.

```yaml
spec:
  leaseRevocationPolicy: Revoke
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="dynamicSecret">
  The `dynamicSecret` field is used to specify which dynamic secret to create leases for. The required fields are `secretName`, `projectId`, `secretsPath`, and `environmentSlug`.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    dynamicSecret:
      secretName: <dynamic-secret-name>
      # Use either projectId OR projectSlug, not both
      projectId: <project-id> # Either projectId or projectSlug is required
      # projectSlug: <project-slug>
      environmentSlug: <env-slug>
      secretsPath: <secrets-path>
  ```

### Applying the InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD to your cluster

Once you have configured the `InfisicalDynamicSecret` CRD with the required fields, you can apply it to your cluster. After applying, you should notice that a lease has been created in Infisical and synced to your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f dynamic-secret-crd.yaml
```

## Auto redeployment

Deployments referring to Kubernetes secrets containing Infisical dynamic secrets don't automatically reload when the dynamic secret lease expires. This means your deployment may use expired dynamic secrets unless manually redeployed.
To address this, we've added functionality to automatically redeploy your deployment when the associated Kubernetes secret containing your Infisical dynamic secret updates.

#### Enabling auto redeploy

To enable auto redeployment you simply have to add the following annotation to the deployment, statefulset, or daemonset that consumes a managed secret.

```yaml
secrets.infisical.com/auto-reload: "true"
```

<Accordion title="Deployment example with auto redeploy enabled">
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
  annotations:
    secrets.infisical.com/auto-reload: "true" # <- redeployment annotation
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: managed-secret # The name of your managed secret, the same that you're using in your InfisicalDynamicSecret CRD (spec.managedSecretReference.secretName)
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
</Accordion>
<Info>
  #### How it works
  When the lease changes, the operator will check to see which deployments are using the operator-managed Kubernetes secret that received the update.
  Then, for each deployment that has this annotation present, a rolling update will be triggered. A redeployment won't happen if the lease is renewed, only if it's recreated.
