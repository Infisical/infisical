You can find the Infisical Ansible collection on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infisical/vault/).


This Ansible Infisical collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of Infisical services. This collection is maintained by the Infisical team.


## Ansible version compatibility
Tested with the Ansible Core >= 2.12.0 versions, and the current development version of Ansible. Ansible Core versions prior to 2.12.0 have not been tested.

## Python version compatibility
This collection depends on the Infisical SDK for Python.

Requires Python 3.7 or greater.

## Installing this collection
You can install the Infisical collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash 
$ ansible-galaxy collection install infisical.vault
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by ansible-galaxy. They can be manually installed using pip:
  
```bash
$ pip install infisical-python
```

## Using this collection

You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN), such as `infisical.vault.read_secrets`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `infisical.vault` collection in the playbook's collections keyword:


```bash
---
vars:
  read_all_secrets_within_scope: "{{ lookup('infisical.vault.read_secrets', universal_auth_client_id='<>', universal_auth_client_secret='<>', project_id='<>', path='/', env_slug='dev', url='https://spotify.infisical.com') }}"
  # [{ "key": "HOST", "value": "google.com" }, { "key": "SMTP", "value": "gmail.smtp.edu" }]

  read_secret_by_name_within_scope: "{{ lookup('infisical.vault.read_secrets', universal_auth_client_id='<>', universal_auth_client_secret='<>', project_id='<>', path='/', env_slug='dev', secret_name='HOST', url='https://spotify.infisical.com') }}"
  # [{ "key": "HOST", "value": "google.com" }]
```


## Troubleshoot 

<Accordion title="I'm getting a error related to objc[72832]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize]">
  If you get this Python error when you running the lookup plugin:-

  ```
  objc[72832]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
  Fatal Python error: Aborted
  ```

  You will need to add this to your shell environment or ansible wrapper script:-

  ```
  export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
  ```
</Accordion>
