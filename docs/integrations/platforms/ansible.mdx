The documentation for using Infisical to manage secrets in Ansible is currently available [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infisical/vault/).

## Troubleshoot 

<Accordion title="I'm getting a error related to objc[72832]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize]">
  If you get this Python error when you running the lookup plugin:-

  ```
  objc[72832]: +[__NSCFConstantString initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
  Fatal Python error: Aborted
  ```

  You will need to add this to your shell environment or ansible wrapper script:-

  ```
  export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
  ```
