---

Infisical Agent is a client daemon that simplifies the adoption of Infisical by providing a more scalable and user-friendly approach for applications to interact with Infisical.
It eliminates the need to modify application logic by enabling clients to decide how they want their secrets rendered through the use of templates.

## Key Features

- **Token lifecycle maangement**: Automatically authenticates with Infisical and deposits renewed access tokens at specified path for applications to consume
- **Templating**: Renders secrets and dynamic secret leases via user provided templates to desired formats for applications to consume

## Token Renewal

The Infisical agent can help manage the life cycle of access tokens. The token renewal process is split into two main components: a `Method`, which is the authentication process suitable for your current setup, and `Sinks`, which are the places where the agent deposits the new access token whenever it receives updates.

When the Infisical Agent is started, it will attempt to obtain a valid access token using the authentication method you have configured. If the agent is unable to fetch a valid token, the agent will keep trying, increasing the time between each attempt.

Once a access token is successfully fetched, the agent will make sure the access token stays valid, continuing to renew it before it expires.

Every time the agent successfully retrieves a new access token, it writes the new token to the Sinks you've configured.

<Info>
  Access tokens can be utilized with Infisical SDKs or directly in API requests
  to retrieve secrets from Infisical
</Info>

## Templating

The Infisical agent can help deliver formatted secrets to your application in a variety of environments. To achieve this, the agent will retrieve secrets from Infisical, format them using a specified template, and then save these formatted secrets to a designated file path.

Templating process is done through the use of Go language's [text/template feature](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).You can refer to the available secret template functions [here](#available-secret-template-functions). Multiple template definitions can be set in the agent configuration file to generate a variety of formatted secret files.

When the agent is started and templates are defined in the agent configuration file, the agent will attempt to acquire a valid access token using the set authentication method outlined in the agent's configuration.
If this initial attempt is unsuccessful, the agent will momentarily pauses before continuing to make more attempts.

Once the agent successfully obtains a valid access token, the agent proceeds to fetch the secrets from Infisical using it.
It then formats these secrets using the user provided templates and writes the formatted data to configured file paths.


### Available secret template functions

The secret template functions is what you will use to fetch resources such as static secrets and dynamic secret leases from Infisical. Below is a list of the available secret template functions that you can use in your templates.


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="listSecrets">
    ```bash
      listSecrets "<project-id>" "environment-slug" "<secret-path>" "<optional-modifier>"
    ```
      ```bash example-template-usage-1
    {{- with listSecrets "6553ccb2b7da580d7f6e7260" "dev" "/" `{"recursive": false, "expandSecretReferences": true}` }}
    {{- range . }}
    {{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}

  {{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}
  {{- else}}
  {{ .SecretPath }}/{{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}
  {{- end}}
  {{- end }}
  {{- end }}
    ```

    

  **Function name**: listSecrets

  **Description**: This function can be used to render the full list of secrets within a given project, environment and secret path. 

  An optional JSON argument is also available. It includes the properties `recursive`, which defaults to false, and `expandSecretReferences`, which defaults to true and expands the returned secrets.


  **Returns**: A single secret object with the following keys `Key, WorkspaceId, Value, SecretPath, Type, ID, and Comment`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="getSecretByName">
    ```bash
    getSecretByName "<project-id>" "<environment-slug>" "<secret-path>" "<secret-name>"
    ```

  ```bash example-template-usage
  {{ with getSecretByName "d821f21d-aa90-453b-8448-8c78c1160a0e" "dev" "/" "POSTHOG_HOST"}}
  {{ if .Value }}
  password = "{{ .Value }}"
  {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
  ```

  **Function name**: getSecretByName

  **Description**: This function can be used to render a single secret by it's name.

  **Returns**: A list of secret objects with the following keys `Key, WorkspaceId, Value, Type, ID, and Comment`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="dynamic_secret">
    ```bash
    dynamic_secret "<project-slug>" "<environment-slug>" "<secret-path>" "<dynamic-secret-name>" "<lease-ttl>"
    ```

    ```bash example-redis-dynamic-secret
      {{ with dynamic_secret "aaa-o7en-s5qm" "dev" "/" "redis" "1m" }}
      {{ .DB_USERNAME }}={{ .DB_PASSWORD }}
      {{- end }}

    ```

    **Function Name**: dynamic_secret

    **Description**: This function can be used to render a dynamic secret lease credentials. The credentials are automatically renewed before they expire, ensuring that the rendered credentials are always up-to-date.

    **Returns**: An object with keys corresponding to the dynamic secret lease credentials.

    <Tip>
      Note that if you have multiple dynamic secret templates with identical configurations, only one lease will be created in Infisical for those templates, and the same lease will be written to your specified destination paths.
    </Tip>

## Caching

The Infisical Agent supports clientside caching of Dynamic Secret leases. If the cache is enabled, the agent will persist the dynamic secret leases to the cache across restarts of the agent.

### Persistent Caching

The Agent currently only supports persistent caching. To utilize persistent caching, you must be within a Kubernetes environment. We recommend using the [Infisical Agent Injector](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent-injector) to inject the agent into pods within your Kubernetes cluster on demand.

### Cache eviction

Cache eviction is the process of removing cached data from the cache. The Agent will automatically evict cached data when the cache is full during a garbage collection cycle which is triggered every 10 minutes.

The cache will automatically evict cached data that has gone stale or is about to go stale. For dynamic resources (such as dynamic secret leases), there's a TTL (Time-to-Live) associated with each lease which is used to determine if the lease is stale or about to go stale.
If a stale dynamic secret lease is detected, it will be automatically evicted from the cache and replaced with a new up-to-date lease.


### Cache Configuration

Configuring the cache is done through the agent configuration file. The following fields are available to configure the cache:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Persistent Caching">
    <ParamField query="cache.persistent.type" type="string">
      The type of persistent caching to use. Currently only `kubernetes` is available, and will only work within Kubernetes environments.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField query="cache.persistent.path" type="string">
      The path to where your persistent cache will be stored.
    </ParamField>

    <Note>
      Persistent caching is only supported within kubernetes environments at the moment. Please refer to the [Infisical Agent Injector](/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent-injector) documentation for more information on how to use persistent caching within Kubernetes environments.
    </Note>

  ```yaml example-agent-config-file.yaml
  cache:
  persistent:
    type: "kubernetes"
    path: "/home/infisical/cache"
    service-account-token-path: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"
  ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Retrying mechanism

The agent will automatically attempt to retry failed API requests such as authentication, secrets retrieval, dynamic secret lease provisioning, etc.
By default, the agent will retry up to 3 times with a base delay of 200ms and a maximum delay of 5s.

You can configure the retrying mechanism through the agent configuration file. The following fields are available to configure the retrying mechanism:


<ParamField query="infisical.retry-strategy.max-retries" type="number">
  How many times to retry failed API requests such as authentication, secret retrieval, etc. Defaults to `3` retries.
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="infisical.retry-strategy.max-delay" type="duration">
  The maximum delay between retries. Defaults to `5s` (5 seconds).
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="infisical.retry-strategy.base-delay" type="duration">
  The base delay between retries. Defaults to `200ms` (200 milliseconds).
</ParamField>

```yaml example-agent-config-file.yaml
infisical:
  address: "https://app.infisical.com"
  retry-strategy:
    max-retries: 3
    max-delay: "5s"
    base-delay: "200ms"

# ... rest of the agent configuration file
```



## Agent configuration file

To set up the authentication method for token renewal and to define secret templates, the Infisical agent requires a YAML configuration file containing properties defined below.
While specifying an authentication method is mandatory to start the agent, configuring sinks and secret templates are optional.

## Quick start Infisical Agent

To install the Infisical agent, you must first install the [Infisical CLI](/cli/overview) in the desired environment where you'd like the agent to run. This is because the Infisical agent is a sub-command of the Infisical CLI.

Once you have the CLI installed, you will need to provision programmatic access for the agent via [Universal Auth](/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth). To obtain a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**, follow the step by step guide outlined [here](/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth).

Next, create agent config file as shown below. The example agent configuration file defines the token authentication method, one sink location, and a secret template.

```yaml example-agent-config-file.yaml
infisical:
  address: "https://app.infisical.com"
auth:
  type: "universal-auth"
  config:
    client-id: "./client-id"
    client-secret: "./client-secret"
    remove_client_secret_on_read: false
sinks:
  - type: "file"
    config:
      path: "/some/path/to/store/access-token/file-name"
templates:
  - source-path: my-dot-ev-secret-template
    destination-path: /some/path/.env
    config:
      polling-interval: 60s
      execute:
        timeout: 30
        command: ./reload-app.sh
```

The secret template below will be used to render the secrets with the key and the value separated by `=` sign. You'll notice that a custom function named `secret` is used to fetch the secrets.
This function takes the following arguments: `secret "<project-id>" "<environment-slug>" "<secret-path>"`.

```text my-dot-ev-secret-template
{{- with secret "6553ccb2b7da580d7f6e7260" "dev" "/" }}
{{- range . }}
{{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

After defining the agent configuration file, run the command below pointing to the path where the agent configuration file is located.

```bash
infisical agent --config example-agent-config-file.yaml
```
