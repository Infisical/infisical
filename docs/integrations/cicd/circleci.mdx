Prerequisites:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorize Infisical for CircleCI">
    Obtain an API token in User Settings > Personal API Tokens

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    Press on the CircleCI tile and input your CircleCI API token to grant Infisical access to your CircleCI account.

    <Info>
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which CircleCI project and press create integration to start syncing secrets to CircleCI.
