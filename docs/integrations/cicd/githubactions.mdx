<Warning>
    Infisical can sync secrets to GitHub repo secrets only. If your repo uses environment secrets, then stay tuned with this [issue](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues/54).
</Warning>

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- Ensure you have admin privileges to the repo you want to sync secrets to.

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

## Authorize Infisical for GitHub

Press on the GitHub tile and grant Infisical access to your GitHub account (repo privileges only).

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant Infisical access to your project's environment variables.
  Although this step breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which GitHub repo and press start integration to start syncing secrets to the repo.
