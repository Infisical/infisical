<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

Then enter your Digital Ocean Personal Access Token here. Then click "Connect to Digital Ocean App Platform".
