    <Info>
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Fly.io app and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Fly.io.
