  <Tab title="Usage">
    <Warning>
      Infisical integrates with Netlify's new environment variable experience. If
      your site uses Netlify's old environment variable experience, you'll have to
      upgrade it to the new one to use this integration.
    </Warning>
    
    Prerequisites:

    - Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Netlify">
        Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.
        
        ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

        Press on the Netlify tile and grant Infisical access to your Netlify account.

        ![integrations netlify authorization](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-auth.png)

        <Info>
          If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
          Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
          breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
          the cloud platform.
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start integration">
        Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Netlify app and context. Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Netlify.

      </Step>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Netlify integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an OAuth application in Netlify
  and registering your instance with it.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an OAuth application in Netlify">
        Navigate to your User settings > Applications > OAuth to create a new OAuth application.
        
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-user-settings.png) 
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app.png) 
          
          Create the OAuth application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/netlify/oauth2/callback`.

        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app-form.png) 
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your Netlify OAuth application credentials to Infisical">
        Obtain the **Client ID** and **Secret** for your Netlify OAuth application.
        
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-credentials.png) 
        
        Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Netlify OAuth application.

        - `CLIENT_ID_NETLIFY`: The **Client ID** of your Netlify OAuth application.
        - `CLIENT_SECRET_NETLIFY`: The **Secret** of your Netlify OAuth application.
        
        Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Netlify integration.
