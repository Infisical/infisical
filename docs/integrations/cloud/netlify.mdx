    <Warning>
      Infisical integrates with Netlify's new environment variable experience. If
      your site uses Netlify's old environment variable experience, you'll have to
      upgrade it to the new one to use this integration.
    </Warning>
    
    Prerequisites:

    - Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Netlify integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an OAuth application in Netlify
  and registering your instance with it.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an OAuth application in Netlify">
        Navigate to your User settings > Applications > OAuth to create a new OAuth application.
        
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-user-settings.png) 
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app.png) 
          
          Create the OAuth application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/netlify/oauth2/callback`.

        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app-form.png) 
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your Netlify OAuth application credentials to Infisical">
        Obtain the **Client ID** and **Secret** for your Netlify OAuth application.
        
        ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-credentials.png) 
        
        Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Netlify OAuth application.

        - `CLIENT_ID_NETLIFY`: The **Client ID** of your Netlify OAuth application.
        - `CLIENT_SECRET_NETLIFY`: The **Secret** of your Netlify OAuth application.
        
        Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Netlify integration.
