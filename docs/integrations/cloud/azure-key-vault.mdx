  <Tab title="Usage">
    Prerequisites:

    - Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
    - Set up Azure and have an existing key vault

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Azure Key Vault">
        Navigate to your project's integrations tab

        ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

        Press on the Azure Key Vault tile and grant Infisical access to Azure Key Vault.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start integration">
        Obtain the Vault URI of your key vault in the Overview tab.

        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-vault-uri.png)

        Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to your key vault. Then, input your Vault URI from the previous step. Finally, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Azure Key Vault.

        <Info>
          If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
          Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
          breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
          the cloud platform.

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Azure KV integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
    and registering your instance with it.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
        Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.
        
        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-aad.png) 
        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-new-app.png) 

        Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/azure-key-vault/oauth2/callback`.
        
        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-new-app-form.png) 
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
        Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-credentials-1.png) 
        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-credentials-2.png) 
        ![integrations Azure KV config](../../images/integrations/azure-key-vault/integrations-azure-key-vault-config-credentials-3.png) 
        
        Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

        - `CLIENT_ID_AZURE`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
        - `CLIENT_SECRET_AZURE`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.
        
        Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure KV integration.
