Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

## Enter your Render API Key

Obtain a Render API Key in your Render Account Settings > API Keys.

![integrations render dashboard](../../images/integrations/render/integrations-render-dashboard.png)
![integrations render token](../../images/integrations/render/integrations-render-token.png)

Press on the Render tile and input your Render API Key to grant Infisical access to your Render account.

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Render service and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Render.
