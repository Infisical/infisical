Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorize Infisical for TeamCity">
    Obtain a TeamCity Access Token in Profile > Access Tokens

    <Note>
      For this integration to work, the TeamCity Access Token must either have the
      **Same as current user** account-wide permission enabled or, if **Limit per project**
      is selected, then it must at minimum have the **View build configuration settings** and **Edit project** permissions enabled.
    </Note>

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    Press on the TeamCity tile and input your TeamCity Access Token and Server URL to grant Infisical access to your TeamCity account.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which TeamCity project (and optionally build configuration) and press create integration to start syncing secrets to TeamCity.

    <Note>
      Infisical integrates with both TeamCity's project-level and build configuration-level environment variables.
      
      To sync secrets to a specific build configuration in a TeamCity project, you can select a build configuration from the **TeamCity Build Config** dropdown; otherwise, leaving it empty will sync secrets to TeamCity at the project-level.
