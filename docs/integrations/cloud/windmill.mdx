    <Warning>
      Secrets synced to Windmill are subject to the [ownership path
      prefix](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/roles_and_permissions)
      convention of Windmill. Accordingly, all secrets must be prefixed with either
      `u/` or `f/` for user-based and folder-based secret along with the name of the
      secret. Put differently, you must use the full path of the secret as its name
      in Infisical to be considered valid such as `u/user/FOO/BAR`.
