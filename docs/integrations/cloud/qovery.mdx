Prerequisites:

  <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Qovery">
    Obtain a Qovery API Token in Settings > API Token.

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

    Press on the Qovery tile and input your Qovery API Token to grant Infisical access to your Qovery account.

    <Info>
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it is necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to Qovery and press create integration to start syncing secrets.
