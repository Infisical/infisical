Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

## Authorize Infisical for Vercel

Press on the Vercel tile and grant Infisical access to your Vercel account.

![integrations vercel authorization](../../images/integrations-vercel-auth.png)

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Vercel app and environment. Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Vercel.

<Info>
  Infisical syncs every envar to Vercel with type `encrypted` unless an existing
  envar with the same name in Vercel exists with a different type. Note that
  Infisical will not be able to update Vercel envars with type `sensitive` since
  they can only be decrypted and modified by Vercel's deployment systems.
</Info>

<Warning>
  The following environment variable names are reserved by Vercel and cannot be
  synced: `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`, `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`,
  `NOW_REGION`, `TZ`, `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`, `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`,
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`,
  `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
</Warning>
