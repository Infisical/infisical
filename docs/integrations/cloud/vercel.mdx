  <Tab title="Usage">
    Prerequisites:
    - Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Vercel">
        Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

        ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

        Press on the Vercel tile and grant Infisical access to your Vercel account.

        ![integrations vercel authorization](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-auth.png)

        <Info>
          If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
          Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
          breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
          the cloud platform.
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start integration">
        Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Vercel app and environment. Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Vercel.

        ![integrations vercel](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel.png)

        <Info>
          Infisical syncs every envar to Vercel with type `encrypted` unless an existing
          envar with the same name in Vercel exists with a different type. Note that
          Infisical will not be able to update Vercel envars with type `sensitive` since
          they can only be decrypted and modified by Vercel's deployment systems.
        </Info>

        <Warning>
          The following environment variable names are reserved by Vercel and cannot be
          synced: `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`, `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`,
          `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`,
          `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`,
          `NOW_REGION`, `TZ`, `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`, `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`,
          `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`,
          `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
        </Warning>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Vercel integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an integration in Vercel.
    and registering your instance with it.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an integration in Vercel">
        Navigate to Integrations > Integration Console to create a new integration.
  
        ![integrations Vercel config](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-config-integrations-console.png) 
        ![integrations Vercel config](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-config-new-app.png) 
        
        Create the application. As part of the form, set a **URL Slug** to a unique slug like `infisical-your-domain` and keep it handy. Also, set **Redirect URL** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/vercel/oauth2/callback`. Lastly,
        be sure to set the API Scopes according to the second screenshot below.
      
        ![integrations Vercel config](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-config-new-app-form-1.png) 
        ![integrations Vercel config](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-config-new-app-form-2.png) 
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your Vercel integration credentials and information to Infisical">
        Obtain the **Client (Integration) ID** and **Client (Integration) Secret** as well as the **URL Slug** from earlier for your Vercel integration.

        ![integrations Vercel config](../../images/integrations/vercel/integrations-vercel-config-credentials.png) 
      
        Back in your Infisical instance, add three new environment variables for the credentials of your Vercel integration.

        - `CLIENT_ID_VERCEL`: The **Client (Integration) ID** of your Vercel integration.
        - `CLIENT_SECRET_VERCEL`: The **Client (Integration) Secret** of your Vercel integration.
        - `CLIENT_SLUG_VERCEL`: The **URL Slug** of your Vercel integration.
        
        Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Vercel integration.
