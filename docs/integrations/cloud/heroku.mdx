## Authorize Infisical for Heroku

Press on the Heroku tile and grant Infisical access to your Heroku account.

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Heroku app and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Heroku.
