Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Railway">
    Obtain a Railway API Token in your Railway [Account Settings > Tokens](https://railway.app/account/tokens).

    <Note>
        If this is your first time creating a Railway API token, then you'll be prompted to join
        Railway's Private Boarding Beta program on the Railway Account Settings > Tokens page. 
        
        Note that Railway project tokens will not work for this integration since they don't work with
        Railway's Public API.
    </Note>

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    Press on the Railway tile and input your Railway API Key to grant Infisical access to your Railway account.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Railway project and environment (and optionally service). Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Railway.

    <Note>
      Infisical integrates with both Railway's [shared variables](https://blog.railway.app/p/shared-variables-release) at the project environment level as well as service variables at the service level.
      
      To sync secrets to a specific service in a project, you can select a service from the Railway Service dropdown; otherwise, leaving it empty will sync secrets to the shared variables of that project.
