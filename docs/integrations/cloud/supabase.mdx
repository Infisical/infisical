---

<Note>
    The Supabase integration is useful if your Supabase project uses sensitive-information such as [environment variables in edge functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/secrets).
    
    Synced envars can be accessed in edge functions using Deno's built-in handler: `Deno.env.get(MY_SECRET_NAME)`.
</Note>

Prerequisites:

- Have an account and project set up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

## Enter your Supabase Access Token

Obtain a Supabase Access Token in your Supabase [Account > Access Tokens](https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens).
![integrations supabase dashboard](../../images/integrations/supabase/integrations-supabase-dashboard.png)
![integrations supabase token](../../images/integrations/supabase/integrations-supabase-token.png)

Press on the Supabase tile and input your Supabase Access Token to grant Infisical access to your Supabase account.

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Supabase project. Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Supabase.
