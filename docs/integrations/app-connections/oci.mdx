<Info>
    OCI App Connection is a paid feature.

    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

Infisical supports the use of [API Signing Key Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm) to connect with OCI.
