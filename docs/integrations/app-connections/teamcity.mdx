Infisical supports connecting to TeamCity using Access Tokens.

## Setup TeamCity Connection in Infisical

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to your profile on TeamCity">
        Navigate to the TeamCity **Profile** page by clicking on your profile icon in the bottom-left corner.
        ![TeamCity Main Page](/images/app-connections/teamcity/teamcity-main-page.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select Access Tokens Tab">
        Select the **Access Tokens** tab from the left sidebar navigation menu.
        ![TeamCity Token Page](/images/app-connections/teamcity/teamcity-token-page.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the Access Token">
        Click the **Create access token** button and provide a name for your token (e.g., "Infisical Integration"). You may set an expiration date or leave it blank for no expiry.
        The permission scope can either be **Same as current user** or **Limit per project**.

        If you're choosing **Limit per project**, make sure you select the relevant project and enable the permissions relevant to your use case:

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Secret Sync Permissions">
                - View build configuration settings
                - Edit project
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        ![TeamCity Token Popup](/images/app-connections/teamcity/teamcity-token-popup.png)

        <Note>
            Setting your permission scope to **Same as current user** will allow your integration to access multiple projects as long as the current user has read and write access to them.
        </Note>
        <Note>
            If you configure an expiry date for your access token, you must manually rotate to a new token before the expiration date to prevent service interruption.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy the Access Token">
        After creation, a modal with the Access Token will be displayed. Copy this token immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to view it again after closing this dialog.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Token Created">
        You should now see your newly created token in the list of access tokens.
