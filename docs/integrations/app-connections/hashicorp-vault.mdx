            <Step title="Enable New Method">
                In the **Authentication Methods** tab, click on **Enable new method**.

            <Step title="Enable Method">
                You may change the name of the method, but we suggest keeping it as `approle`.

            <Step title="Navigate to Vault Policies">
                From the home page, navigate to **Policies**.

            </Step>
            <Step title="Create Policy">
                You may name your policy whatever you want, but remember the name as it will be used in future steps.

                Depending on your use case, you may have different policy configurations:

                <Tabs>
                    <Tab title="Secret Sync">
                        ```hcl
                        path "demo_mount/data/*" {
                          capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update" ]
                        }

                        path "sys/mounts" {
                          capabilities = ["read"]
                        }
                        ```

                        - **demo_mount**: The name of the target secrets engine (e.g., 'secret', 'kv').
                        - **data/\***: The path within the secrets engine used for storing secrets. The wildcard (*) grants access to all secrets within this mount point.

                        <Note>
                            Make sure to replace the policy path with the specific path where you intend to sync your secrets. For better security and control, it's recommended to use a more granular path instead of a wildcard (*). You can also specify a path that doesn’t yet exist—Infisical will automatically create it for you during the sync process.

                <Note>
                    If you used custom approle or policy names in previous steps, you'll need to customize the following commands.
                </Note>

                **Create Infisical Role**

                ```hcl
                vault write auth/approle/role/infisical token_policies="infisical-policy" token_ttl=30s token_max_ttl=2m
                ```

                **Read RoleID**

                ```hcl
                vault read auth/approle/role/infisical/role-id
                ```

                **Generate New SecretID**

                ```hcl
                vault write -force auth/approle/role/infisical/secret-id
                ```

                Your shell output should look similar to the image below. Save the RoleID and SecretID values for later steps.

## Getting Vault Instance URL

    For self-hosted instances, locate and copy your vault's base URL (for example: `https://vault.example.com`).

    Save the URL for later steps.

    <Tab title="Hashicorp Cloud Platform">
        On HCP instances, you may need to navigate to **Cluster Overview** to see your cluster URL. Save this value for later steps.
