Infisical currently only supports two methods for connecting to Azure, which are OAuth and Client Secrets.

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
  Using the Azure App Configuration connection on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
  and registering your instance with it.

  **Prerequisites:**

  - Set up Azure and have an existing App Configuration instance.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
      Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.

      <Info>
        Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID.
      </Info>
      ![Azure app config](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-aad.png)
      ![Azure app config](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-new-app.png)

      Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/azure/oauth/callback`.
      <Tip>
        The domain you defined in the Redirect URI should be equivalent to the `SITE_URL` configured in your Infisical instance.
      </Tip>

      ![Azure app config](/images/app-connections/azure/register-callback.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the application">

      For the Azure Connection to work with App Configuration, you need to assign multiple permissions to the application.

      #### Azure App Configuration permissions
    
      Set the API permissions of the Azure application to include the following Azure App Configuration permissions: `KeyValue.Delete`, `KeyValue.Read`, and `KeyValue.Write`.
      ![Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/app-api-permissions.png)


    </Step>
    <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
      Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

      ![Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-1.png)
      ![Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-2.png)
      ![Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-3.png)

      Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_APP_CONFIGURATION_CLIENT_ID`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_APP_CONFIGURATION_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.

      <Note>
        If you can't directly access and modify environment variables, you can update them using the [Server Admin Console](/documentation/platform/admin-panel/server-admin#environment-variables-tab).
      </Note>

      Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure App Configuration connection.
    </Step>
    </Steps>    

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Client Secret Authentication">
  To use client secret authentication, ensure your Azure Service Principal has the required permissions and is connected to the Azure App Configuration resources you want to use.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - Set up Azure and have an existing App Configuration instance.
  - The service principal must be connected to your target Azure App Configuration resource(s)

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the service principal">

      Configure the required API permissions for your App Registration to interact with Azure App Configuration:

      #### Azure App Configuration permissions
    
      Set the API permissions of your Azure service principal to include the following Azure App Configuration permissions: `KeyValue.Delete`, `KeyValue.Read`, and `KeyValue.Write`.

## Setup Azure Connection in Infisical

<Steps>
	<Step title="Navigate to App Connections">
		Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in the desired project, then select **App Connections**. ![App Connections
		Tab](/images/app-connections/general/add-connection.png)
	</Step>
  <Step title="Add Connection">
    Select the **Azure Connection** option from the connection options modal. ![Select Azure Connection](/images/app-connections/azure/app-configuration/select-connection.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Connection">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="OAuth">
        <Step title="Authorize Connection">
          You can optionally authenticate against a specific tenant by providing the Azure Tenant or Directory ID.

          Now select the **OAuth** method and click **Connect to Azure**. 

          ![Connect via Azure OAUth](/images/app-connections/azure/app-configuration/create-oauth-method.png)
	      </Step>
	      <Step title="Grant Access">
	        You will then be redirected to Azure to grant Infisical access to your Azure account. Once granted,
	        you will redirect you back to Infisical's App Connections page. ![Azure App Configuration
	        Authorization](/images/app-connections/azure/grant-access.png)
	      </Step>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Client Secret">
        <Step title="Create Connection">
          Fill in the **Tenant ID**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields with the Directory (Tenant) ID, Application (Client) ID and Client Secret you obtained in the previous step.

          ![Connect via Azure OAUth](/images/app-connections/azure/app-configuration/create-client-secrets-method.png)
        </Step>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connection Created">
		Your **Azure App Configuration Connection** is now available for use. ![Assume Role AWS Connection](/images/app-connections/azure/app-configuration/oauth-connection.png)
	</Step>
