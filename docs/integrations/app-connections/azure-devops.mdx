description: "Learn how to configure an Azure DevOps Connection for Infisical."
---

Infisical currently supports three methods for connecting to Azure DevOps, which are OAuth, Azure DevOps Personal Access Token and Client Secrets.

<Accordion title="Azure OAuth on a Self-Hosted Instance">
  Using the Azure DevOps <b>OAuth connection</b> on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
  and registering your instance with it.

  **Prerequisites:**

  - Set up Azure.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
      Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.

      <Info>
        Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID.
      </Info>
      ![Azure devops](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-aad.png)
      ![Azure devops](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-new-app.png)

      Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/azure/oauth/callback`.
      <Tip>
        The domain you defined in the Redirect URI should be equivalent to the `SITE_URL` configured in your Infisical instance.
      </Tip>

      ![Azure devops](/images/app-connections/azure/register-callback.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the application">

      For the Azure Connection to work with DevOps Pipelines, you need to assign the following permission to the application.

      #### Azure DevOps permissions
    
      Set the API permissions of the Azure application to include the following permissions: 
        - Azure DevOps
          - `user_impersonation`
          - `vso.project_write`
          - `vso.variablegroups_manage`
          - `vso.variablegroups_write`

      ![Azure devops](/images/integrations/azure-devops/app-api-permissions.png)


    </Step>
    <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
      Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** and **Directory (Tenant) ID** (this will be used later in the Infisical connection) in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

      ![Azure devops](../../images/app-connections/azure/client-secrets/config-credentials-1.png)
      ![Azure devops](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-2.png)
      ![Azure devops](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-3.png)

      Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_ID`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.

      Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure Client Secrets connection.
    </Step>
    </Steps>    

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT)">
    #### Create a new Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT)
    When using the Azure DevOps <b>Access Token connection</b> you'll need to create a new personal access token (PAT) in order to authenticate Infisical with Azure DevOps.
    <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Azure DevOps">
        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-devops/overview-page.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a new token">
        Make sure the newly created token has Read/Write access to the Release scope.
        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-devops/create-new-token.png)

        <Note>
        Please make sure that the token has access to the following scopes: Variable Groups _(read, create, & manage)_, Release _(read/write)_, Project and Team _(read)_, Service Connections _(read & query)_
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy the new access token">
        Copy the newly created token as this will be used to authenticate Infisical with Azure DevOps.
        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-devops/new-token-created.png)
    </Step>
    </Steps>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client Secret Authentication">
  To use client secret authentication, ensure your Azure Service Principal has the required permissions and is connected to the Azure DevOps organization and projects you want to use.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - Set up Azure and have an existing Azure DevOps organization.
  - The service principal must be connected to your target Azure DevOps organization and project(s)

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the service principal">

      Configure the required API permissions for your App Registration to interact with Azure DevOps:

      #### Azure DevOps permissions
    
      Set the API permissions of your Azure service principal to include the following Azure DevOps permissions: 
        - Azure DevOps
          - `user_impersonation`
          - `vso.project_write`
          - `vso.variablegroups_manage`
          - `vso.variablegroups_write`
