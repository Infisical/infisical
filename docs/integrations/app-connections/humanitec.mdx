    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a Service User">
        Create a new service user. Take into account that the role set here will affect the permissions of the API Token so be sure to set it so the Service User has access permissions to the App you want to integrate to Infisical.

    <Step title="Create the API Token for the Service User">
        Create the API token for the service user.
        This token's permission will be limited to the **Service User** role.

            If you configure an expiry date for your API token you will need to manually rotate to a new token prior to expiration to avoid integration downtime.
