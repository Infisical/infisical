Connect Infisical to Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) for automated certificate issuance and management.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) server running and accessible
- Domain administrator account with certificate management permissions
- Network connectivity from Infisical to the ADCS server
- ADCS web enrollment enabled on your server

## Connection Setup

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to App Connections">

      ![Select Azure ADCS Connection](/images/app-connections/azure-adcs/azure-adcs-select-connection.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Connection Details">
      **Configuration Tab:**
    - **Name**: Friendly name for this ADCS connection (e.g., "Production ADCS")
    - **ADCS URL**: Your ADCS HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://adcs.yourdomain.com/certsrv`) - only HTTPS is supported
    - **Username**: Domain administrator username (format: `DOMAIN\username` or `username@domain.com`)
    - **Password**: Password for the domain administrator account
    
    **SSL Tab:**
    - **SSL Certificate**: Optional PEM certificate for custom CA certificates or self-signed certificates
    - **Reject Unauthorized**: Whether to reject connections with invalid SSL certificates (it's recommended to keep it enabled)
    
    <Note>
    **Getting the SSL Certificate**: If your ADCS server uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a custom CA, you can obtain the certificate using OpenSSL or PowerShell:
    
    **Using OpenSSL:**
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect your-adcs-server:443 -showcerts
    ```
    
    **Using PowerShell (from inside your ADCS Server):**
    ```powershell
    Import-Module WebAdministration -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    $binding = Get-WebBinding -Protocol https -Port 443
    if ($binding -and $binding.certificateHash) {
        $cert = Get-ChildItem -Path "Cert:\LocalMachine\My\$($binding.certificateHash)"
        if ($cert) {
            $certBase64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.RawData)
            $certPem = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`n" + ($certBase64 -replace '(.{64})', '$1`n') + "`n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
            Write-Output $certPem
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Copy the certificate content (including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` lines) and paste it into the SSL Certificate field.
    </Note>

    And click **Connect to ADCS** to establish the connection.
