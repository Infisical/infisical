Infisical supports GitHub App installation for creating a GitHub Radar Connection.

<Note>
    GitHub Radar Connections are specifically configured for [Secret Scanning](/documentation/platform/secret-scanning/overview) and require specific permissions and webhook configuration.

    Check out our [GitHub Connection](/integrations/app-connections/github) for secret management features such as [Secret Syncs](/integrations/secret-syncs/overview).
</Note>

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
    Using a GitHub Radar Connection with app authentication on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application on GitHub
    and registering your instance with it.

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Create an application on GitHub">
            Navigate to the GitHub App Settings [here](https://github.com/settings/apps). Click **New GitHub App**.

            <Note>
                If you have a GitHub organization, you can create an application under it
                in your organization Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App.
            </Note>

            Configure the following fields:

            1. **Name** - give your app a name
            2. **Homepage URL** - your self-hosted domain (i.e. `https://your-domain.com`)
            3. **Callback URL** - the callback URL for your domain (i.e. `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/github-radar/oauth/callback`)
            4. **User Authorization** - enable request user authorization on app installation

            ![github radar app details](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-2.png)

            Enable and configure the Webhook fields:

            - **Webhook URL** - the webhook URL for your domain (i.e. `https://your-domain.com/secret-scanning/webhooks/github`)
            - **Webhook Secret** - a strong, generated secret to verify webhook payloads
            - **SSL Verification** - enable SSL verification

            Set the following repository permissions:
            - **Contents**: `Read-only`
            - **Metadata**: `Read-only`

            ![github radar app permissions 2](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-5.png)

            Subscribe to the following events:
            - **Push**

            ![github radar app events](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-6.png)

            Create the Github application.
            ![github radar app complete](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-7.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
            Generate a new **Client Secret** for your GitHub application.
            ![github radar app client secret](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-8.png)

            Generate a new **Private Key** for your Github application.

            <Info>You will need to copy the contents of the .pem file downloaded</Info>

            ![github radar app private key](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-9.png)

            Obtain the following credentials:

            1. **Slug** - the slug of your application found in the URL
            2. **App ID** - the ID of your application
            3. **Client ID** - the client ID of your application
            4. **Client Secret** - the client secret generated above
            5. **Private Key** - the contents of the private key .pem file generated above
            6. **Webhook Secret** - the secret generated in the previous step when configuring the webhook

            ![github radar app credentials](/images/app-connections/github-radar/self-hosted-github-radar-step-10.png)

            Back in your Infisical instance, add the six new environment variables for the credentials of your GitHub Radar application:

            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_CLIENT_ID`: The **Client ID** of your GitHub application.
            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your GitHub application.
            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_SLUG`: The **Slug** of your GitHub application. This is the one found in the URL.
            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_ID`: The **App ID** of your GitHub application.
            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The **Private Key** of your GitHub application.
            - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_RADAR_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The **Webhook Secret** of your GitHub application.

            Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the GitHub integration via app authentication.
