Infisical supports [service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) to connect with your GCP projects.

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
    Using the GCP integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring a service account on GCP and
    configuring your instance to use it.

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API">
            ![Service Account API](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-credentials-api.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console">
            ![Service Account IAM Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-overview.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Create a Service Account">
            Create a new service account that will be used to impersonate other GCP service accounts for your app connections.
            ![Create Service Account Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-instance-service-account.png)

            Press "DONE" after creating the service account.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Generate Service Account Key">
            Download the JSON key file for your service account. This will be used to authenticate your instance with GCP.
            ![Service Account Credential Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-service-account-credential.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Configure Your Instance">
            1. Copy the entire contents of the downloaded JSON key file.
            2. Set it as a string value for the `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL` environment variable.
            3. Restart your Infisical instance to apply the changes.
            4. You can now use GCP integration with service account impersonation.

## Configure Service Account for Infisical

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console">
        ![Service Account Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-overview.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Service Account">
        Create a new service account with an ID that follows this requirement:
        
        Your service account ID must end with the first two sections of your Infisical organization ID.
        
        Example:
        - Infisical organization ID: `df92581a-0fe9-42b5-b526-0a1e88ec8085`
        - Required service account ID suffix: `df92581a-0fe9`

        ![Create Service Account](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-service-account.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Service Account Permissions">
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Secret Sync">
                Add the required permissions for secret syncs:
                ![Assign Service Account Permission](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-secret-sync-permission.png)
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        After configuring the appropriate roles, press "DONE".
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable Service Account Impersonation">
        To enable service account impersonation, you'll need to grant the **Service Account Token Creator** role to the Infisical instance's service account. This configuration allows Infisical to securely impersonate the new service account.
        - Navigate to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section in your Google Cloud Console
        - Select the newly created service account
        - Click on the "PERMISSIONS" tab
        - Click "Grant Access" to add a new principal

        If you're using Infisical Cloud US, use the following service account: infisical-us@infisical-us.iam.gserviceaccount.com

        If you're using Infisical Cloud EU, use the following service account: infisical-eu@infisical-eu.iam.gserviceaccount.com
