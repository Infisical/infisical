Infisical supports [service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-impersonation) to connect with your GCP projects.

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
    Using the GCP integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring a service account on GCP and
    configuring your instance to use it.

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API">
            ![Service Account API](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-credentials-api.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console">
            ![Service Account IAM Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-overview.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Create a Service Account">
            Create a new service account that will be used to impersonate other GCP service accounts for your app connections.
            ![Create Service Account Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-instance-service-account.png)

            Press "DONE" after creating the service account.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Generate Service Account Key">
            Download the JSON key file for your service account. This will be used to authenticate your instance with GCP.
            ![Service Account Credential Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-service-account-credential.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Configure Your Instance">
            1. Copy the entire contents of the downloaded JSON key file.
            2. Set it as a string value for the `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL` environment variable.
            3. Restart your Infisical instance to apply the changes.
            4. You can now use GCP integration with service account impersonation.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
        Before using service account impersonation, ensure that the IAM Service Account Credentials API is enabled for the project containing the service account that will be impersonated. Run the following command, replacing `projectId` with your GCP project ID:
        ```bash
        gcloud services enable iamcredentials.googleapis.com --project=projectId
        ```

## Configure Service Account for Infisical

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console">
        ![Service Account Page](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-overview.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Service Account">
        Create a new service account with an ID that follows this requirement:
        
        Your service account ID must end with the first two sections of your Infisical organization ID.
        
        Example:
        - Infisical organization ID: `df92581a-0fe9-42b5-b526-0a1e88ec8085`
        - Required service account ID suffix: `df92581a-0fe9`

        ![Create Service Account](/images/app-connections/gcp/create-service-account.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Service Account Permissions">
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Secret Sync">
                Add the required permissions for secret syncs:
                ![Assign Service Account Permission](/images/app-connections/gcp/service-account-secret-sync-permission.png)
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        After configuring the appropriate roles, press "DONE".
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable Service Account Impersonation">
        To enable service account impersonation, you'll need to grant the **Service Account Token Creator** role to the Infisical instance's service account. This configuration allows Infisical to securely impersonate the new service account.
        - Navigate to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts section in your Google Cloud Console
        - Select the newly created service account
        - Click on the "PERMISSIONS" tab
        - Click "Grant Access" to add a new principal

        If you're using Infisical Cloud US, use the following service account: infisical-us@infisical-us.iam.gserviceaccount.com

        If you're using Infisical Cloud EU, use the following service account: infisical-eu@infisical-eu.iam.gserviceaccount.com
