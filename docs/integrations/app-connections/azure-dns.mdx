Infisical supports connecting to Azure DNS using a Service Principal with Client Secrets for secure access to manage DNS records in your Azure DNS zones.

<Accordion title="Client Secret Authentication">
  To use client secret authentication, ensure your Azure Service Principal has the required permissions to manage DNS records in your Azure DNS Zone.

  **Prerequisites:**
  - Set up Azure and have an existing DNS Zone.
  - An Azure Service Principal (App Registration) with a Client Secret.

    <Step title="Navigate to your DNS Zone">
      In the Azure Portal, navigate to your DNS Zone that you want to use for ACME DNS validation. Click on **Access control (IAM)** in the left sidebar, then click **Add** > **Add role assignment**.
