description: "Learn how to configure an Azure Client Secrets Connection for Infisical."
---

Infisical currently only supports two methods for connecting to Azure, which are OAuth and Client Secrets.

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
  Using the Azure Client Secrets connection on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
  and registering your instance with it.

  **Prerequisites:**

  - Set up Azure.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
      Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.

      <Info>
        Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID.
      </Info>
      ![Azure client secrets](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-aad.png)
      ![Azure client secrets](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-new-app.png)

      Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/azure/oauth/callback`.
      <Tip>
        The domain you defined in the Redirect URI should be equivalent to the `SITE_URL` configured in your Infisical instance.
      </Tip>

      ![Azure client secrets](/images/app-connections/azure/register-callback.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the application">

      For the Azure Connection to work with Client Secrets, you need to assign the following permission to the application.

      #### Azure Client Secrets permissions
    
      Set the API permissions of the Azure application to include the following permissions: 
        - Microsoft Graph
          - `Application.ReadWrite.All`
          - `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy`
          - `Application.ReadWrite.All` (Delegated)
          - `Directory.ReadWrite.All` (Delegated)
          - `User.Read` (Delegated)

      ![Azure client secrets](/images/integrations/azure-client-secrets/app-api-permissions.png)


    </Step>
    <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
      Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** and **Directory (Tenant) ID** (this will be used later in the Infisical connection) in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

      ![Azure client secrets](../../images/app-connections/azure/client-secrets/config-credentials-1.png)
      ![Azure client secrets](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-2.png)
      ![Azure client secrets](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-3.png)

      Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRETS_CLIENT_ID`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRETS_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.

      <Note>
        If you can't directly access and modify environment variables, you can update them using the [Server Admin Console](/documentation/platform/admin-panel/server-admin#environment-variables-tab).
      </Note>

      Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure Client Secrets connection.
    </Step>
    </Steps>

        <Tip>
          Keep in mind that both the certificate and its private key are required to configure the Azure Client Secrets connection in Infisical.

## Setup Azure Connection in Infisical

<Steps>
	<Step title="Navigate to App Connections">
		Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in the desired project, then select **App Connections**. ![App Connections

        You will then be redirected to Azure to grant Infisical access to your Azure account. Once granted,
        you will be redirected back to Infisical's App Connections page. ![Azure Client Secrets
        Authorization](/images/app-connections/azure/grant-access.png)
