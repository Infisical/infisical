Infisical supports two methods for connecting to GitHub.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="GitHub App (Recommended)">
        Infisical will use a GitHub App with finely grained permissions to connect to GitHub.

        <Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
            Using the GitHub integration with app authentication on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application on GitHub
            and registering your instance with it.

            <Steps>
                <Step title="Create an application on GitHub">
                    Navigate to the GitHub app settings [here](https://github.com/settings/apps). Click **New GitHub App**.

                    ![integrations github app create](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-create.png)

                    Give the application a name, a homepage URL (your self-hosted domain i.e. `https://your-domain.com`), and a callback URL (i.e. `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/github/oauth/callback`).

                    ![integrations github app basic details](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-basic-details.png)

                    Enable request user authorization during app installation.
                    ![integrations github app enable auth](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-enable-oauth.png)

                    Disable webhook by unchecking the Active checkbox.
                    ![integrations github app webhook](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-webhook.png)

                    Set the repository permissions as follows: Metadata: Read-only, Secrets: Read and write, Environments: Read and write, Actions: Read.
                    ![integrations github app repository](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-repository.png)

                    Similarly, set the organization permissions as follows: Secrets: Read and write.
                    ![integrations github app organization](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-organization.png)

                    Create the Github application.
                    ![integrations github app create confirm](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-create-confirm.png)

                    <Note>
                        If you have a GitHub organization, you can create an application under it
                        in your organization Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App.
                    </Note>
                </Step>
                <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
                    Generate a new **Client Secret** for your GitHub application.
                    ![integrations github app create secret](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-secret.png)

                    Generate a new **Private Key** for your Github application.
                    ![integrations github app create private key](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-private-key.png)

                    Obtain the necessary Github application credentials. This would be the application slug, client ID, app ID, client secret, and private key.
                    ![integrations github app credentials](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-credentials.png)

                    Back in your Infisical instance, you can configure the GitHub App credentials in one of two ways:

                    **Option 1: Server Admin Panel (Recommended)**

                    Navigate to the server admin panel > **Integrations** > **GitHub App** and enter the GitHub application credentials:
                    ![integrations github app admin panel](/images/integrations/github/app/self-hosted-github-app-admin-panel.png)

                    - **Client ID**: The Client ID of your GitHub application
                    - **Client Secret**: The Client Secret of your GitHub application
                    - **App Slug**: The Slug of your GitHub application (found in the URL)
                    - **App ID**: The App ID of your GitHub application
                    - **Private Key**: The Private Key of your GitHub application

                    **Option 2: Environment Variables**

                    Alternatively, you can add the new environment variables for the credentials of your GitHub application:

                    - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`: The **Client ID** of your GitHub application.
                    - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your GitHub application.
                    - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_APP_SLUG`: The **Slug** of your GitHub application. This is the one found in the URL.
                    - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_APP_ID`: The **App ID** of your GitHub application.
                    - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The **Private Key** of your GitHub application.

                    Once configured, you can use the GitHub integration via app authentication. If you configured the credentials using environment variables, restart your Infisical instance for the changes to take effect. If you configured them through the server admin panel, allow approximately 5 minutes for the changes to propagate.
