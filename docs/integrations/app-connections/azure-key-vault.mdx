description: "Learn how to configure a Azure Key Vault Connection for Infisical."

Infisical currently only supports one method for connecting to Azure, which is OAuth.

<Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
  Using the Azure Key Vault connection on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
  and registering your instance with it.

  **Prerequisites:**

  - Set up Azure and have an existing Key Vault instance.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
      Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.

      <Info>
        Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID.
      </Info>

      ![Azure key vault](/images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-new-app.png)

      Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/organization/app-connections/azure/oauth/callback`.
      <Tip>
        The domain you defined in the Redirect URI should be equivalent to the `SITE_URL` configured in your Infisical instance.
      </Tip>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Assign API permissions to the application">

      For the Azure Connection to work with Key Vault, you need to assign multiple permissions to the application.

      #### Azure Key Vault permissions

      Set the API permissions of the Azure application to include `user.impersonation` for the Key Vault API.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
      Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

      ![Azure key vault](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-1.png)

      ![Azure key vault](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-3.png)

      Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_KEY_VAULT_CLIENT_ID`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
      - `INF_APP_CONNECTION_AZURE_KEY_VAULT_CLIENT_SECRET`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.

      Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure Key Vault connection.
    </Step>
