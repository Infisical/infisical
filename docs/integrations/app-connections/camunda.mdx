Infisical supports connecting to Camunda APIs using [client credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-tools/administration-api/authentication/#client-credentials-and-scopes).

## Configure Client Credentials for Infisical

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Organization Management">
        In your Camunda Cloud Console, navigate to the **Organization** tab in the top navigation menu.
        ![Organization Management](/images/app-connections/camunda/camunda-console.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access Administration API">
        From the Organization Management tabs, click on **Administration API** to manage your API credentials and click the **Create client credentials** button.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Name Your Client">
        Enter a recognizable name for your client, such as "my-infisical-client". The name can contain letters, dashes, underscores, and digits.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set Credential Permissions">
        In the "Create new client credentials" modal, select the following permissions required for secret syncs:
        
        - **Cluster**: Enable read access (Get)
        - **Connector secrets**: Enable all operations (Get, Create, Update, Delete)

        These specific permissions are required for Infisical to properly sync and manage your Camunda secrets.

        ![Set Permissions 2](/images/app-connections/camunda/camunda-create-client-2.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Complete Creation">
        Click the **Create** button to generate your client credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
        After creation, you'll be shown your client credentials. For the Infisical connection, you'll need:

        - **Client ID** (`CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_CLIENT_ID`)
        - **Client Secret** (`CAMUNDA_CONSOLE_CLIENT_SECRET`)

        **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to securely save the Client Secret, as it will not be shown again after you close this dialog.

        You can download these credentials or copy them to use in the next section.
