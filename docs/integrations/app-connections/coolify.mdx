Infisical supports connecting to Coolify using API Tokens.

## Create API token in Coolify

<Steps>
    <Step title="Move to Keys & Tokens on Coolify">
        Navigate to the **Keys & Tokens** page by clicking the tab in the right sidebar.
        After that select the **API Tokens** tab in the top bar of the page

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create the API Token">
        Add a description for your token (e.g., "Infisical Integration").
        Choose appropriate scope permissions based on your requirements.
        <Note>
          If you want to use this integration for secret syncing than you must check the **read:sensitive** permission otherwise it will be unable to import existing data
        </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Copy the API Token">
        After creation, a modal with the API token will be displayed. Copy this token immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to view it again after closing this dialog.
        After the creation, the new token will be shown between the form and the list of existing tokens. Copy this token immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to view it again after leaving the page
