## Starting Infisical docs locally

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) for our docs.

#### Install Mintlify CLI

```sh
# with npm
npm i -g mintlify

# or with yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

#### Running the docs

Go to `docs` directory and run `mintlify dev`. This will start up the docs on `localhost:3000` and automatically refresh the page on saved edits.

```sh
# From the root directory
cd docs; mintlify dev;
```
