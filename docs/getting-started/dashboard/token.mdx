title: "Infisical Token"
---

An Infisical Token is needed to authenticate the CLI when there isn't an easy way to input your login credentials.

It's useful for your CI/CD environments and integrations such as [Docker](/integrations/platforms/docker) and [Docker Compose](/integrations/platforms/docker-compose).

To generate the the token, head over to your project settings as shown below.

## Feeding Infisical Token to the CLI

The Infisical CLI checks for the presence of an environment variable called `INFISICAL_TOKEN`. 
If it detects this variable in the terminal where it is being run, it will use it to authenticate and retrieve the environment variables that the token is authorized to access.
This allows you to use the CLI in environments where you are unable to run the `infisical login` command.

<Note>
  The token grants read-only access to a particular environment and project for
  a specified amount of time. Once the token is expired, the CLI using it will no longer be able to make
  requests with it.
