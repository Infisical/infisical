An Infisical Token is useful for:

- Authenticating the [Infisical CLI](/cli/overview) when there isn't an easy way to input your login credentials.
- Granting the [Infisical SDKs](/sdks/overview) access to secrets scoped to a project and environment.

It's also useful for CI/CD environments and integrations such as [Docker](/integrations/platforms/docker) and [Docker Compose](/integrations/platforms/docker-compose).

To generate the the token, head over to your project settings as shown below.

## Feeding Infisical Token to the CLI

The Infisical CLI checks for the presence of an environment variable called `INFISICAL_TOKEN`.
If it detects this variable in the terminal where it is being run, it will use it to authenticate and retrieve the environment variables that the token is authorized to access.
This allows you to use the CLI in environments where you are unable to run the `infisical login` command.
