These examples demonstrate how to store and fetch environment variables from [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com) into your application.

## Set up Infisical Cloud

1. Login or create an account at `app.infisical.com`.
2. Create a new project.
3. Populate your environment variables as in the image below.

## Fetch Secrets for Your App

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
  
    The Infisical CLI is platform-agnostic and enables you to inject environment variables into your app across many tech stacks and frameworks.

    ### Set up the CLI

    1. Follow the instructions to [install our platform-agnostic CLI](/cli/overview).

    2. Initialize Infisical for your project.

    ```bash
    # move to your project
    cd /path/to/project

    # initialize infisical
    infisical init
    ```

    ### Start your app with environment variables injected

    ```bash
    # inject environment variables into app
    infisical run -- [your application start command]
    ```

    Your app should now be running with the environment variables injected.

    Check out our [integrations](/integrations/overview) for injecting environment variables into frameworks and platforms like Docker.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SDK">
    [Infisical SDKs](/sdks/overview) let your app fetch back secrets using an [Infisical Token](/getting-started/dashboard/token) that is scoped to a project and environment in Infisical. In this example, we demonstrate how to use the [Node SDK](/sdks/languages/node).
    
    ### Obtain an [Infisical Token](/getting-started/dashboard/token)
    
    Head to your project settings to create a token scoped to the project and environment you wish to fetch secrets from.

    ![token add](../images/project-token-add.png)

    ### Install the SDK

    ```bash
    npm install infisical-node --save
    ```

    ### Initialize the Infisical client

    ```js
    await infisical.connect({
      token: "your_infisical_token",
    });
    ```

    ### Get a value

    ```js
    const value = infisical.get("SOME_KEY");
    ```

    ### Example with Express

    ```js
    const express = require("express");
    const port = 3000;
    const infisical = require("infisical-node");

    const main = async () => {
      await infisical.connect({
        token: "st.xxx.xxx",
      });

      // your application logic

      app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send(`Howdy, ${infisical.get("NAME")}!`);
      });

      app.listen(port, async () => {
        console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`);
      });
    };
    ```

    <Warning>
      We do not recommend hardcoding your [Infisical
      Token](/getting-started/dashboard/token). Setting it as an environment
      variable would be best.

  </Warning>
  
  Check out our [SDKs](/sdks/overview) for other language SDKs.
