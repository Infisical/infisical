The changelog below reflects new product developments and updates on a monthly basis.

<Update label="January 2026" description="Monthly Update" rss="## January 2026\n\nThis release focuses on safer certificate workflows, broader gateway support for agent-based deployments, and tighter access controls. Highlights include PKI approval workflows, MCP server gateway support, account recovery improvements, organization role APIs, Azure SAML configuration updates, and enhanced project templates for machine identities.">

January was about **making it easier to move fast without giving up control**.

As teams scale their use of certificates, gateways, and machine identities, the pain usually shows up in the same places: manual approvals, brittle access rules, and login flows that break at the worst time. This release tightens those edges — adding clearer approval paths for PKI, expanding gateway support for agent-style deployments, and smoothing out identity and access workflows that teams rely on every day.

---

## Highlights

- **Approve certificate requests with clear, auditable workflows** using PKI approval steps.
- **Deploy Infisical in more agent-driven environments** with MCP server gateway support.
- **Recover accounts and log in with less friction**, including account recovery and password visibility improvements.
- **Automate role and identity management** using the new organization role API.
- **Improve Azure SAML compatibility**, including support for “Sign assertion only” configurations.
- **Move faster with shared reviews and templates**, including URL sharing for approval requests and better machine identity defaults in project templates.
