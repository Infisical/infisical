## Infisical API

The Infisical API (sometimes referred to as the **backend**) contains the core platform logic.

## Storage backend

Infisical relies on a storage backend to store data including users and secrets. Infisical's storage backend is Postgres.

## Redis

Infisical uses [Redis](https://redis.com) to enable more complex workflows including a queuing system to manage long running asynchronous tasks, cron jobs, as well as reliable cache for frequently used resources.

## Infisical Web UI

The Web UI is the browser-based portal that connects to the Infisical API.

## Infisical clients

Clients are any application or infrastructure that connecting to the Infisical API using one of the below methods:
- Public API: Making API requests directly to the Infisical API.
- Client SDK: A platform-specific library with method abstractions for working with secrets. Currently, there are three official SDKs: [Node SDK](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/node), [Python SDK](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/python), and [Java SDK](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/java).
- CLI: A terminal-based interface for interacting with the Infisical API.
- Kubernetes Operator: This operator retrieves secrets from Infisical and securely store
