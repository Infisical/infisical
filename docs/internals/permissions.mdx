## Overview

The Infisical permissions system is based on a role-based access control (RBAC) model. The system allows you to define roles and assign them to users and machines. Each role has a set of permissions that define what actions a user can perform.

Permissions are built on a subject-action-object model. The subject is the resource the permission is being applied to, the action is what the permission allows.
An example of a subject/action combination would be `secrets/read`. This permission allows the subject to read secrets.

Refer to the table below for a list of subjects and the actions they support.

## Subjects and Actions

<Tab title="Project Permissions">

<Note>
  Not all actions are applicable to all subjects. As an example, the
  `secrets-rollback` subject only supports `read`, and `create` as actions.
  While `secrets` support `read`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`.

## Inversion

Permission inversion allows you to explicitly deny actions instead of allowing them. This is supported for the following subjects:

- secrets
- secret-folders
- secret-imports
- dynamic-secrets

When a permission is inverted, it changes from an "allow" rule to a "deny" rule. For example:

```typescript
// Regular permission - allows reading secrets
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: ["read"]
}

// Inverted permission - denies reading secrets
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: ["read"],
  inverted: true
}
```

## Conditions

Conditions allow you to create more granular permissions by specifying criteria that must be met for the permission to apply. This is supported for the following subjects:

- secrets
- secret-folders
- secret-imports
- dynamic-secrets

### Properties

Conditions can be applied to the following properties:

- `environment`: Control access based on environment slugs
- `secretPath`: Control access based on secret paths
- `secretName`: Control access based on secret names
- `secretTags`: Control access based on tags (only supports $in operator)

### Operators

The following operators are available for conditions:

| Operator | Description                        | Example                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `$eq`    | Equal                              | `{ environment: { $eq: "production" } }`              |
| `$ne`    | Not equal                          | `{ environment: { $ne: "development" } }`             |
| `$in`    | Matches any value in array         | `{ environment: { $in: ["staging", "production"] } }` |
| `$glob`  | Pattern matching using glob syntax | `{ secretPath: { $glob: "/app/\*" } }`                |

These details are especially useful if you're using the API to [create new project roles](../api-reference/endpoints/project-roles/create).
The rules outlined on this page, also apply when using our Terraform Provider to manage your Infisical project roles, or any other of our clients that manage project roles.

## Migrating from permission V1 to permission V2

When upgrading to V2 permissions (i.e. when moving from using the `permissions` to `permissions_v2` field in your Terraform configurations, or upgrading to the V2 permission API), you'll need to update your permission structure as follows:

Any permissions for `secrets` should be expanded to include equivalent permissions for:

- `secret-imports`
- `secret-folders` (except for read permissions)
- `dynamic-secrets`

For dynamic secrets, the actions need to be mapped differently:

- `read` → `read-root-credential`
- `create` → `create-root-credential`
- `edit` → `edit-root-credential` (also adds `lease` permission)
- `delete` → `delete-root-credential`

Example:

```hcl
# Old V1 configuration
resource "infisical_project_role" "example" {
  name = "example"
  permissions = [
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = "read"
    },
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = "edit"
    }
  ]
}

# New V2 configuration
resource "infisical_project_role" "example" {
  name = "example"
  permissions_v2 = [
    # Original secrets permission
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = ["read", "edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add equivalent secret-imports permission
    {
      subject = "secret-imports"
      action = ["read", "edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add secret-folders permission (without read)
    {
      subject = "secret-folders"
      action = ["edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add dynamic-secrets permission with mapped actions
    {
      subject = "dynamic-secrets"
      action = ["read-root-credential", "edit-root-credential", "lease"]
      inverted = false
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: When moving to V2 permissions, make sure to include all the necessary expanded permissions based on your original `secrets` permissions.
