## Overview

Infisical is architected around several key components that work in concert to provide a secure and streamlined secret management experience. These components span the client, API, and storage layers, ensuring that secrets are protected at every stage of their lifecycle.

## 1. API (Backend)

Infisical exposes a well-documented [REST API](https://infisical.com/docs/api-reference/overview/introduction) that enables programmatic interaction with the platform, enabling a wide range of use cases.

## 2. Storage Backend

Infisical relies on a robust storage backend to durably store secrets, users, and other platform data. Infisical's storage backend is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## 3. Caching Layer

Infisical uses [Redis](https://redis.com) to enable more complex workflows including a queuing system to manage long-running asynchronous tasks, cron jobs, as well as reliable cache for frequently used resources.

## 4. Clients

Clients are interfaces through which users and applications interact with the Infisical API:

- **Web UI**: A browser-based portal providing a user-friendly interface for managing secrets, configurations, and performing administrative tasks.

- [**CLI**](https://infisical.com/docs/cli): A terminal-based tool for interacting with the Infisical API, enabling automation, scripting, and integration into CI/CD pipelines.

- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Platform-specific libraries with method abstractions for working with secrets. Supported languages include [Node.js](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/node), [Python](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/python), [Java](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/java), [Golang](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/go), [Ruby](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/ruby) and [.NET](https://infisical.com/docs/sdks/languages/csharp).

- [**Kubernetes Operator**](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes): A Kubernetes-native component that facilitates the secure retrieval and management of secrets within a Kubernetes cluster. The operator supports multiple custom resource definitions (CRDs) for syncing secrets.

- [**Infisical Agent**](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/infisical-agent): Daemon that automatically fetches and manages access tokens and secrets to be used in various client resources.
