title: "Note on E2EE"
---

Each project in Infisical can have **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** enabled or disabled.

By default, all projects have **E2EE** enabled which means the server is not able to decrypt any values because all secret encryption/decryption operations occur on the client-side; this can be (optionally) disabled. However, this has limitations around functionality and ease-of-use:

- You cannot make HTTP calls to Infisical to read/write secrets in plaintext.
- You cannot leverage non-E2EE features like native integrations and in-platform automations like dynamic secrets and secret rotation.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Should I have E2EE enabled or disabled?">
    We recommend starting with having **E2EE** enabled and disabling it if:
    
    - You're self-hosting Infisical, so having your instance of Infisical be able to read your secrets isn't an issue.
    - You want an easier way to read/write secrets with Infisical.
    - You need more power out of non-E2EE features such as secret rotation, dynamic secrets, etc.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I enable/disable E2EE?">
    You can enable/disable E2EE for your project in Infisical in the Project Settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is disabling E2EE secure?">
    It is secure and in fact how most vendors in our industry are able to offer features like secret rotation. In this mode, secrets are encrypted at rest by
    a series of keys, secured ultimately by a top-level `ROOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` located on the server.

    If you're concerned about Infisical Cloud's ability to read your secrets, then you may wish to
    use it with **E2EE** enabled or self-host Infisical on your own infrastructure and disable E2EE there.

    As an organization, we do not read any customer secrets without explicit permission; access to the `ROOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is restricted to one individual in the organization.
