Infisical's Public (REST) API provides users an alternative way to programmatically access and manage
secrets via HTTPS requests. This can be useful for automating tasks, such as
rotating credentials, or for integrating secret management into a larger system.

With the Public API, users can create, read, update, and delete secrets, as well as manage access control, query audit logs, and more.

<Warning>
  In April 2023, we added the capability for users to query for secrets by name to improve the user experience of Infisical. If your project was created prior to April 2023, please read and follow the section on [blind indices](./blind-indices) and how to enable them for better usage of Infisical.
