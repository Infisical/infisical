Infisical's Public (REST) API provides users an alternative way to programmatically access and manage
secrets via HTTPS requests. This can be useful for automating tasks, such as
rotating credentials, or for integrating secret management into a larger system.

With the Public API, you can create, read, update, and delete secrets, as well as manage access control, query audit logs, and more.

## API Versioning

The API is versioned on a per-resource basis. A resource's version is only incremented for breaking changes, so different endpoints may have different version numbers (e.g., `/api/v4/secrets` vs. `/api/v1/secret-syncs`).

As a best practice, always use the latest available version for each endpoint to ensure access to the most recent features and improvements.

## Rate Limits

Infisical enforces three different types of rate limits:

- **Read**: For GET and LIST operations.
- **Write**: For CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
- **Secret**: Specifically for secret management operations such as getting and creating secrets.

**Self-hosted** instances have no limits, these limits apply only to **Infisical Cloud**.
