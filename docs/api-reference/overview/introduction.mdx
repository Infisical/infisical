Infisical's Public (REST) API provides users an alternative way to programmatically access and manage
secrets via HTTPS requests. This can be useful for automating tasks, such as
rotating credentials, or for integrating secret management into a larger system.

With the Public API, you can create, read, update, and delete secrets, as well as manage access control, query audit logs, and more.
