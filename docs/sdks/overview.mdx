## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Isn't it inefficient if my app makes a request every time it needs a secret?">
        The client SDK caches every secret and implements a 5-minute waiting period before re-requesting it. The waiting period can be controlled by
        setting the `cacheTTL` parameter at the time of initializing the client.
        
        Note: The exact parameter name may differ depending on the language.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I attach the environment variables to my process environment?">
        Yes you can! The client SDK provides a method to attach the secrets to your process environment. When using the `listSecrets()` method, you
        can pass a `attachToProcessEnv` parameter, which tells the SDK to attach all the found secrets to your process environment.
        
        Note: The exact parameter name may differ depending on the language.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What if a request for a secret fails?">
        The SDK caches every secret and falls back to the cached value if a request fails. If no cached value is found, and the request fails, then the SDK throws an error.
