From local development to production, Infisical SDKs provide the easiest way for your app to fetch back secrets from Infisical on demand. 

- Install and initialize a language-specific client SDK into your application
- Provision the client scoped-access to a project and environment in Infisical
- Fetch secrets on demand

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Are my secrets exposed in transit every time the SDK fetches them?">
        No. Infisical uses end-to-end encryption which ensures that secrets are always encrypted in transit
        and decrypted on the client side. In fact, not even the server can decrypt your secrets (unless 
        that permission is explicitly granted from within the platform).

        Check out the [security guide](/security/overview).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Isn't it inefficient if my app makes a request every time it needs a secret?">
        The client SDK caches every secret and implements a 5-minute waiting period before
        re-requesting it. The waiting period can be controlled by setting the `cacheTTL` parameter at
        the time of initializing the client.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What if a request for a secret fails?">
        The SDK caches every secret and falls back to the cached value if a request fails. If no cached
        value ever-existed, the SDK falls back to whatever value is on `process.env`.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Can I still use process.env with the SDK?">
        Yes. If no `token` parameter is passed in at the time of initializing the client or nothing is found when requesting for a secret,
        then the SDK falls back to whatever value is on `process.env`.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What's the point if I still have to manage a token for the SDK?">
        The token enables the SDK to authenticate with Infisical to fetch back your secrets.
        Although the SDK requires you to pass in a token, it enables greater efficiency and security
        than if you managed dozens of secrets yourself without it. Here're some benefits:

        - You always pull in the right secrets because they're fetched on demand from a centralize source that is Infisical.
        - You can use the Infisical which comes with tons of benefits like secret versioning, access controls, audit logs, etc.
        - You now risk leaking one token that can be revoked instead of dozens of raw secrets.
        
        And much more.
