---

Infisical SDKs provide the easiest way for your app to fetch back secrets using an [Infisical Token](/getting-started/dashboard/token) and has a few benefits:

- Local development: Replace 10s of environment variables in your `.env` file with 1 environment variable (the [Infisical Token](/getting-started/dashboard/token)).
- Production: Fetch secrets back to any cloud regardless of if an integration exists between Infisical and the cloud platform.

We currently only have the [Node SDK](/sdks/languages/node) available but more language SDKs are coming out soon:

- [Node](/sdks/languages/node)
- [Python](/sdks/languages/python)
- [Java](/sdks/languages/java)
- [Ruby](/sdks/languages/ruby)
- [Go](/sdks/languages/go)
- [Rust](/sdks/languages/rust)
