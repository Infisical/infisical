Prerequisites:
- Have an account with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a container service in AWS Lightsail">
        1.1. In AWS, navigate to the **Lightsail** service and press **Create container service** under the **Containers** tab.

        1.2. In the **Container service location** section, select the AWS region that's closest to your infrastructure. 
        
        Afterwards, in the **Container service capacity** section, set the power level and scale to fit your needs; you may opt for the default setting
        and adjust accordingly in the future.

        1.3. In the **Set up your first deployment** section, select the **Specify a custom deployment** option. Give the container a friendly name like **infisical** and fill in your intended [Infisical public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical) in the **Image** field; this will pull the image from Docker Hub.
        
        For example, in order to opt for Infisical `v0.43.4`, you would input: `infisical/infisical:v0.43.4`.

        1.4. Running Infisical requires a few environment variables to be set for the container service.
        At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
        which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        
        In the **Environment variables** section, fill in the required environment variables.
        
        <Note>
            To use more features like emailing and single sign-on, you can set additional configuration options [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        </Note>
        
        Also, under the **Open ports** section, add an entry for port `8080` and protocol `HTTP` since Infisical listens on port `8080`.

        1.5. In the **Public endpoint** section, select the container from the previous steps from the dropdown; this will make the container accessible over the public internet.

        1.6. Finally, in the **Identify your service** section, give the container service a unique name like infisical and press **Create container service**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to your deployed instance of Infisical">
        On the newly-created container service page, wait for the **Status** to turn to **Running** and check out the **Public domain** of the container service; you can access your instance of Infisical by this URL.

  <Accordion title="Do you have any recommendations for deploying Infisical with AWS Lightsail?">
    Yes, here are a few that come to mind:
    - In step 1.3, we recommend pinning the Docker image to a specific [version of Infisical](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags)
    instead of referring to the `latest` tag to avoid any unexpected version-to-version migration issues.
  
    We're working on putting together a fuller list of deployment best practices as well as minimum resource configuration requirements for running Infisical so stay tuned!
