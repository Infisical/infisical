description: "Learn how to run Infisical with Docker."
---

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Infisical is available as a single Docker image to ease deployment.
This Docker image only includes the application code, meaning you must supply a connection to a Postgres database and a Redis instance.
The following guide provides a detailed step-by-step walkthrough on how you can deploy Infisical with Docker.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull the Infisical Docker image">
    Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags) and select a version of Infisical image you would like to deploy.
    Then run the following command in your terminal to pull the specific Infisical Docker image.
    
    ```
    docker pull infisical/infisical:<version>
    ```
    
    Remember to replace `<version>` with the docker image tag of your choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Postgres schema migration ">
    Before you can start the instance of Infisical, you need to run the database schema migrations. 
    Follow the step by [step guide here](/self-hosting/configuration/schema-migrations) on running schema migrations for Infisical.
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Infisical">
    For a minimal installation of Infisical, you must configure `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `DB_CONNECTION_URI`, `SITE_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`.     [View all available configurations](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    

    We recommend using Cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions for PostgreSQL and Redis to ensure high availability. 

    Once you have added the required environment variables to your docker run command, execute it in your terminal to get Infisical up and running.
    
    For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:8080  \
    -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=f40c9178624764ad85a6830b37ce239a \
    -e AUTH_SECRET="q6LRi7c717a3DQ8JUxlWYkZpMhG4+RHLoFUVt3Bvo2U=" \
    -e DB_CONNECTION_URI="<>" \
    -e REDIS_URL="<>" \
    -e SITE_URL="<>" \
    infisical/infisical:<version>
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      The above environment variable values are only to be used as an example and should not be used in production 
    </Warning>
    
      Once the container is running, verify the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:80`.

### Additional discussion 
It's important to note that the above is a basic example of deploying Infisical using Docker. 
In practice, for production deployments, you may want to use container orchestration platforms such as AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Kubernetes. 
These platforms offer additional features like scalability, load balancing, and automated deployment, making them suitable for handling production-level traffic and providing high availability.
