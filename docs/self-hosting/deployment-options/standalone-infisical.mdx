description: "Run Infisical with Docker"
---

Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull the Infisical Docker image">
    Run the following command in your terminal to pull the Infisical Docker image:
    
    ```
    docker pull infisical/infisical:latest
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Infisical">
    2.1. Running Infisical requires a few environment variables to be set.
    At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
    which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    
    Once you have added the required environment variables to your docker run command, execute it in your terminal to get Infisical up and running.
    
    For example:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:8080  \
    -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=f40c9178624764ad85a6830b37ce239a \
    -e AUTH_SECRET="q6LRi7c717a3DQ8JUxlWYkZpMhG4+RHLoFUVt3Bvo2U=" \
    -e MONGO_URL="<>" \
    infisical/infisical:latest
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      The above environment variable values are only to be used as an example and should not be used in production 
    </Warning>
    
    2.2. Once the container is running, verify the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:80`.

  <Accordion title="What are the system requirements for running Infisical?">
    To have a functional deployment, we recommended compute with 2GB of RAM and 1 CPU.
    
    However, depending on your usage, you may need to further scale up system resources to meet demand.
