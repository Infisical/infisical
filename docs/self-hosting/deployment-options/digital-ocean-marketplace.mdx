Infisical can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with a single click through our Digital Ocean marketplace application.
The initiation of the installation process triggers the creation of a Kubernetes cluster, followed by the installation of Infisical onto that cluster.

This automated deployment method uses the same process under the hood as the manual [Kubernetes installation guide](./kubernetes-helm).

### Initiate the installation

To start the process, click the following button and follow the instructions there.

### Access Infisical Web
Once the installation finishes, head to the `Networking` section via the sidebar and select `Load Balancers`.
Within this section, you'll find the newly created load balancer for Infisical. You can access Infisical at the IP address allocated to that load balancer.

### Adjusting configurations
If you need to either upgrade or downgrade Infisical, or modify environment variables to alter its functionality, refer to our [Kubernetes installation](./kubernetes-helm) page for detailed instructions.

Because Digital Ocean deploys the same Helm application as described in our [Kubernetes installation](./kubernetes-helm) guide, you can utilize that guide to implement the required changes.
It's important to note that any modifications requires familiarly with Helm package manager.
