Prerequisites:
- Have an account with [Railway](https://railway.app/)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Deploy the Infisical template with Railway">
        1.1. In Railway, create a new project and select **Deploy a template > Infisical**.
        
        ![Railway create project](/images/self-hosting/deployment-options/railway/railway-create-project.png)

        ![Railway deploy template](/images/self-hosting/deployment-options/railway/railway-deploy-template.png)

        ![Railway template overview](/images/self-hosting/deployment-options/railway/railway-template-overview.png)

        1.2. At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
        which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        
        By default, the Infisical template on Railway pre-configures environment variables on each service in the deployment but requires you to supply two for the Redis and MongoDB services.
        
        On the MongoDB service, supply a value for the `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` variable.

        On the Redis service, supply a value for the `REDIS_PASSWORD` variable.

        <Note>
            To use more features like emailing and single sign-on, you can set additional configuration options on the Infisical service [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        </Note>
        
        Finally, press **Deploy** to create the project and deploy the services within it.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to your deployed instance of Infisical">
        Head to the newly-created Infisical service to view its URL under Networking > Public Networking; you can access your instance of Infisical by clicking on the URL.

  <Accordion title="Do you have any recommendations for deploying Infisical with Railway?">
    Yes, here are a few that come to mind:
    - While the Infisical template on Railway uses the `latest` tag to get the latest version of Infisical, we recommend creating a Railway deployment that pins the Docker image to a specific [version of Infisical](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags) to avoid any unexpected version-to-version migration issues.
    - We recommend selecting **Deployment region** options for your Railway service deployments to be closest to your infrastructure/clients to reduce latency.
  
    We're working on putting together a fuller list of deployment best practices as well as minimum resource configuration requirements for running Infisical so stay tuned!
