## Install Docker on your VM

```bash
# Example in ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt install docker-compose
```

## Download the required files

```bash
# Download env file template
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example

# Download docker compose template
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.yml

# Download nginx config
mkdir nginx && wget -O ./nginx/default.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/nginx/default.dev.conf
```

## Update .env file 
Tweak the `.env` according to your preferences. Refer to the available [environment variables](/self-hosting/configuration/envars)

```bash
# update environment variables like mongo login
nano .env
```

<Info>
  Infisical assumes that you have configured HTTPS. If you didn't configure HTTPS, set `HTTPS_ENABLED` to `false` in the .env file to avoid frequent logouts.
</Info>

## Get the service up and running

```bash
# Start up services in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Your Infisical installation is complete and should be running on [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80). Please note that the containers are not exposed to the internet and only bind to the localhost. It's up to you to configure a firewall, SSL certificates, and implement any additional security measures.

<Info>
Once installation is complete, you will have to create the first account. No default account is provided.
