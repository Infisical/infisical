**Prerequisites**
- An account at Render.com 
- A document DB instance

Deploying on Render is one of the quickest ways to have Infisical running in production. 
Before you start deployment, you will need to obtain document db connection string. This will be used for `MONGO_URL` environment variable required during installation.

You can create a document db database using services such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [AWS DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/), and others. Once done, click the link below to start deployment.
