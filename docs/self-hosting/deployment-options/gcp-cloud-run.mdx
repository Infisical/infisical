Prerequisites:
- Have an account with [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a project in GCP">
        In GCP, create a new project and give it a friendly name like Infisical.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a service in GCP Cloud Run">
        2.1. Inside the GCP project, navigate to the **Cloud Run** product and create a new service.

        2.2. In the service creation form, select the **Deploy one revision from an existing container image** option and fill in your intended [Infisical public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical) in the container image URL.

        For example, in order to opt for Infisical `v0.43.4`, you would input: `docker.io/infisical/infisical:v0.43.4`.

        2.3. Running Infisical requires a few environment variables to be set for the GCP Cloud Run service.
        At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
        which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        
        For this step, fill in the required environment variables in the Edit Container > Variables & Secrets > Environment variables section.
        
        <Note>
            To use more features like emailing and single sign-on, you can set additional configuration options [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        </Note>

        <Note>
            Depending on your use-case and requirements, you may find it helpful to further configure your GCP Cloud Run service.

            For example, you may want to adjust the **Region** option to specify which region to deploy the underlying container for your
            instance of Infisical to minimize distance and therefore latency between the instance and your infrastructure.
        </Note>

        Finally, press **Create** to finish setting up the GCP Cloud Run service.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to your deployed instance of Infisical">
        Head to the **Service details** of the newly-created service to view its URL; you can access your instance of Infisical by clicking on the URL.

  <Accordion title="Do you have any recommendations for deploying Infisical with GCP Cloud Run?">
    Yes, here are a few that come to mind:
    - In step 2, we recommend pinning the Docker image to a specific [version of Infisical](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags)
    instead of referring to the `latest` tag to avoid any unexpected version-to-version migration issues.
    - In step 2, we recommend selecting a **Region** option that is closest to your infrastructure/clients to reduce latency.
  
    We're working on putting together a fuller list of deployment best practices as well as minimum resource configuration requirements for running Infisical so stay tuned!
