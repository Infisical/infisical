Prerequisites:
    - Have an account with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us)

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Web App in Azure App Services">
        1.1. In Azure, navigate to the **App Services** solution and press **Create > Web App**.

        1.2. In the **Basics** section, specify the **Subscription** and **Resource group** to manage the deployed resource.
        
        Also, give the container a friendly name like Infisical and specify a **Region** for it to be deployed to.

        1.3. In the **Docker** section, select the **Single Container** option under **Options** and specify **Docker Hub** as the image source
        
        Next, under the **Docker hub options** sub-section, select the **Public** option under **Access Type** and fill in your intended [Infisical public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical) in the **Image and tag** field; this will pull the image from Docker Hub.
        
        For example, in order to opt for Infisical `v0.43.4`, you would input: `infisical/infisical:v0.43.4`.

        1.4. Finally, in the **Review + create** section, double check the information from the previous steps and press **Create** to create the Azure app service.

        1.5. Next, wait a minute or two on the deployment overview page for the app to be created. Once the deployment is complete, press **Go to resource**
        to head to the **App Service dashboard** for the newly-created app.

        1.6. Running Infisical requires a few environment variables to be set for the Azure app service.
        At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
        which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).

        <Note>
            To use more features like emailing and single sign-on, you can set additional configuration options [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
        </Note>
        
        Additionally, you must set the variable `WEBSITES_PORT=8080` since
        Infisical listens on port `8080`.
        
        In the **Settings > Configuration** section of the newly-created app service, fill in the required environment variables.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to your deployed instance of Infisical">
        In the **Overview** section, check out the **Default domain** for your instance of Infisical; you can visit the instance at this URL.

  <Accordion title="Do you have any recommendations for deploying Infisical with Azure App Services?">
    Yes, here are a few that come to mind:
    - In step 1.3, we recommend pinning the Docker image to a specific [version of Infisical](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags)
    instead of referring to the `latest` tag to avoid any unexpected version-to-version migration issues.
    - In step 1.2, we recommend selecting a **Region** option that is closest to your infrastructure/clients to reduce latency.
  
    We're working on putting together a fuller list of deployment best practices as well as minimum resource configuration requirements for running Infisical so stay tuned!
