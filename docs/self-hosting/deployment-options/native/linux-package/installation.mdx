description: "Learn how to deploy Infisical using the Linux package"
---

Infisical can be deployed on Linux virtual machines without the need for containers using our standalone Linux packages. 
These packages are available in both .deb (for Debian-based systems) and .rpm (for RHEL-based systems) formats.
The installation includes the Infisical service, along with a CLI tool (infisical-ctl) to help you manage configurations, startup, and application logging. 
This approach is ideal for environments where containerization isn't desired, while still providing a lightweight deployment option.

## Prerequisites

This installation method only provides the Infisical application. You are responsible for configuring both PostgreSQL and Redis, either by using managed services (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure Database, GCP Cloud SQL/Memorystore) or by deploying them manually in your on-prem environment. 
Please ensure you have the following before beginning installation of Infisical:

- A Linux server running a Debian/Ubuntu or RHEL-based distribution
- A running PostgreSQL database instance (version 14 and up)
- A running Redis database instance (versions 6.x or 7.x)

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install the Infisical Package">
  Select your Linux distribution to get started. Only AMD64-based systems are supported at this time, ARM support is coming soon.

  <Tabs>

  <Tab title="Debian/Ubuntu">
  Add the Infisical repository:
  ```bash
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-core/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
  ```

  Install Infisical:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y infisical-core
  ```

  > **Note**: For production use, we recommend locking to a specific version to ensure consistency. [View available versions](https://cloudsmith.io/~infisical/repos/infisical-core/packages/).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux">
  Add the Infisical repository:
  ```bash
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-core/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
  ```

  Install Infisical:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install infisical-core
  ```

  > **Note**: For production use, we recommend locking to a specific version to ensure consistency. [View available versions](https://cloudsmith.io/~infisical/repos/infisical-core/packages/).
  </Tab>

  </Tabs>

  Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  infisical-ctl help
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Configuration File">
  Create an `infisical.rb` file at `/etc/infisical`. This file contains your database connection strings and other runtime settings.

  ```ruby
  # Important: Replace with secure values in production
  infisical_core['ENCRYPTION_KEY'] = '6c1fe4e407b8911c104518103505b218'
  infisical_core['AUTH_SECRET'] = '5lrMXKKWCVocS/uerPsl7V+TX/aaUaI7iDkgl3tSmLE='

  # Example database connection strings
  infisical_core['DB_CONNECTION_URI'] = 'postgres://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-host>:<db-port>/<db-name>'
  infisical_core['REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://<redis-host>:<redis-port>'
  ```

  See the full list of options in our [configuration documentation](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Infisical">
  1. Start the Infisical service:
    ```bash
    infisical-ctl reconfigure
    ```
    The server runs on port `8080` by default (customizable in `infisical.rb`).

  2. Check the service status:
      ```bash
      infisical-ctl status
      ```

    View the service logs in real-time:
      ```bash
      infisical-ctl tail
      ```
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Platform Support

### Microsoft Windows
Infisical is built for Linux-based systems. It is not supported on Microsoft Windows, and we do not plan to support it in the near future. For Windows users, consider running Infisical in a virtual machine or WSL2 environment.

### Unsupported Linux Distributions and Unix-like Systems
Infisical is not tested or officially supported on the following:

- Arch Linux  
- Fedora  
- FreeBSD  
- Gentoo  
- macOS  

We recommend sticking to officially supported distributions for the best experience.

## Linux vs Containerized Deployments

Infisical is a stateless application, which means it can be easily scaled and redeployed without maintaining internal state between instances.

If your use case requires rolling updates, self-healing, or auto-scaling, we recommend deploying Infisical in a containerized environment such as Kubernetes/OpenShift, or using managed container orchestration services like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run. 
These platforms offer built-in capabilities for high availability and help simplify operational overhead for your deployment.
