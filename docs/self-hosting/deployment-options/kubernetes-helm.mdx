description: "Use Helm chart to install Infisical on your Kubernetes cluster"
---

**Prerequisites**

- You have extensive understanding of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Installed [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) version v3.11.3 or greater
- You have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) installed and connected to your kubernetes cluster

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Infisical Helm repository ">
    ```bash
    helm repo add infisical-helm-charts 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/helm-charts/helm/charts/' 
    ```
    ```
    helm repo update
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Helm values">
    Create a `values.yaml` file. This will be used to configure settings for the Infisical Helm chart.
    To explore all configurable properties for your values file, [visit this page](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/tree/main/helm-charts/infisical-standalone-postgres/README.md#parameters).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Infisical version">
    By default, the Infisical version set in your helm chart will likely be outdated. 
    Choose the latest Infisical docker image tag from here [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags).


    ```yaml values.yaml
    infisical:
      image:
        repository: infisical/infisical
        tag: "v0.46.2-postgres" # <-- update
        pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ```
    <Warning>
      Do you not use the latest docker image tag in production deployments as they can introduce unexpected changes
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">

    To deploy this Helm chart, a Kubernetes secret named `infisical-secrets` must be present in the same namespace where the chart is being deployed.

    For a minimal installation of Infisical, you need to configure `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `DB_CONNECTION_URI`, and `REDIS_URL`. [Learn more about configuration settings](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).


    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Proof of concept deployment">
        For test or proof-of-concept purposes, you may omit `DB_CONNECTION_URI` and `REDIS_URL` from `infisical-secrets`. This is because the Helm chart will automatically provision and connect to the in-cluster instances of Postgres and Redis by default.
        ```yaml simple-values-example.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: infisical-secrets
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          AUTH_SECRET: <>
          ENCRYPTION_KEY: <>
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Production deployment">
        For production environments, we recommend using Cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions for PostgreSQL and Redis to ensure high availability. In on-premise setups, it's recommended to configure Redis and Postgres for high availability, either by using Bitnami charts or a custom configuration.
        ```yaml simple-values-example.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: infisical-secrets
        type: Opaque
        stringData:
          AUTH_SECRET: <>
          ENCRYPTION_KEY: <>
          REDIS_URL: <>
          DB_CONNECTION_URI: <>
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Database schema migration ">
    Infisical relies a relational database, which means that database schemas need to be migrated before the instance can become operational. 
    
    To automate this process, the chart includes a option named `infisical.autoDatabaseSchemaMigration`.
    When this option is enabled, a deployment/upgrade will only occur _after_ a successful schema migration.

    <Info>
      If you are using in-cluster Postgres, you may notice the migration job failing initially.
      This is expected as it is waiting for the database to be in ready state.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Routing traffic to Infisical">
    By default, this chart uses Nginx as its Ingress controller to direct traffic to Infisical services.

    ```yaml values.yaml
    ingress:
      nginx:
        enabled: true
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Helm chart ">
    Once you are done configuring your `values.yaml` file, run the command below.

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install infisical infisical-helm-charts/infisical-standalone --values /path/to/values.yaml
    ```

      fullnameOverride: "infisical"

      infisical:
        enabled: true
        name: infisical
        autoDatabaseSchemaMigration: true
        fullnameOverride: ""

      postgresql:
        enabled: true
        name: "postgresql"
        fullnameOverride: "postgresql"
        auth:
          username: infisical
          password: root
          database: infisicalDB

      redis:
        enabled: true
        name: "redis"
        fullnameOverride: "redis"
        cluster:
          enabled: false

        auth:
          password: "mysecretpassword"
        architecture: standalone
      ```
      </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Infisical">
    After deployment, please wait for 2-5 minutes for all pods to reach a running state. Once a significant number of pods are operational, access the IP address revealed through Ingress by your load balancer. 
    You can find the IP address/hostname by executing the command `kubectl get ingress`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrade your instance">
    To upgrade your instance of Infisical simply update the docker image tag in your Halm values and rerun the command below.

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install infisical infisical-helm-charts/infisical-standalone --values /path/to/values.yaml
    ```

    <Tip>
      Always back up your database before each upgrade, especially in a production environment.
