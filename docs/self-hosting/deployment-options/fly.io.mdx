Prerequisites:
- Have an account with [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
- Have installed the [Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an app with Fly.io">
    In your terminal, run the following command from the source directory of your project to create a new Fly.io app
    with a `fly.toml` configuration file:
    
    ```
    fly launch
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the fly.toml configuration file">
    Add a **build** section to the `fly.toml` file to specify the [Infisical public Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical):

    ```
    [build]                                                                         
    image = "infisical/infisical:v0.43.4"
    ```

    Afterwards, your `fly.toml` file should look similar to:

    ```
    app = "infisical"
    primary_region = "lax"

    [http_service]
    internal_port = 8080
    force_https = true
    auto_stop_machines = true
    auto_start_machines = true
    min_machines_running = 0
    processes = ["app"]

    [[vm]]
    cpu_kind = "shared"
    cpus = 1
    memory_mb = 1024

    [build]
    image = "infisical/infisical:v0.43.4"
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Depending on your use-case and requirements, you may find it helpful to further configure your `fly.toml` file
      with options [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/).

      For example, you may want to adjust the `primary-region` option to specify which [region](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/) to create the new machine for your
      instance of Infisical to minimize distance and therefore latency between the instance and your infrastructure.
    </Note>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set secrets for your Fly.io app">
    Running Infisical requires a few environment variables to be set on the Fly.io machine.
    At minimum, Infisical requires that you set the variables `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `MONGO_URL`, and `REDIS_URL`
    which you can read more about [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    
    For this step, we recommend setting the variables as Fly.io [app secrets](https://fly.io/docs/reference/secrets/) which 
    are made available to the app as environment variables. You can set the variables either via the Fly.io CLI or project [dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard).
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="CLI">
        Run the following command (with each `VALUE` replaced) in the source directory of your project to set the required variables:

        ```
        flyctl secrets set ENCRYPTION_KEY=VALUE AUTH_SECRET=VALUE MONGO_URL=VALUE REDIS_URL=VALUE...
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Dashboard">
        In Fly.io, head to your Project > Secrets and add the required variables.

        ![Fly.io deployment secrets](/images/self-hosting/deployment-options/flyio/flyio-secrets.png)
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Note>
      To use more features like emailing and single sign-on, you can set additional configuration options [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the Fly.io app">
    Finally, run the following command in the source directory of your project to deploy your Infisical instance on Fly.io
    with the updated `fly.toml` configuration file from step 2 and secrets from step 3:

    ```
    fly deploy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you have any recommendations for deploying Infisical with Fly.io?">
    Yes, here are a few that come to mind:
    - In step 2, we recommend pinning the Docker image to a specific [version of Infisical](https://hub.docker.com/r/infisical/infisical/tags)
    instead of referring to the `latest` tag to avoid any unexpected version-to-version migration issues.
    - In step 2, we recommend selecting a `primary_region` option that is closest to your infrastructure/clients to reduce latency; a full list of regions supported by Fly.io can be found [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/).
  
    We're working on putting together a fuller list of deployment best practices as well as minimum resource configuration requirements for running Infisical so stay tuned!
