description: "Learn to install Infisical on Fly.io"
---

**Prerequisites**
- Familiar with Fly.io deployment 
- Logged in via fly CLI

#### 1. Make a copy of the deployment config
To begin, you'll to make a copy of the following file on your local machine

```toml fly.toml 
# fly.toml app configuration file generated for infisical on 2023-05-05T08:57:03-04:00
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
#

app = "infisical"
primary_region = "iad"

[build]
  image = "infisical/infisical:latest"

[env]
  ENCRYPTION_KEY = <>
  JWT_AUTH_SECRET = <>
  JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = <>
  JWT_SERVICE_SECRET = <>
  JWT_SIGNUP_SECRET = <>
  MONGO_URL = <>

[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080

```

#### 2. Add environment variables

Before we can deploy Infisical, we'll need to provide values for the keys under `[env]` config block. For each of the following keys

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `JWT_AUTH_SECRET`
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`
- `JWT_SERVICE_SECRET`
- `JWT_SIGNUP_SECRET`

you will need to generate a random 16 byte hex string. This can can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 16`. 


Lastly, the `MONGO_URL` environment variable requires a document database connection URL. 
You can obtain this URL by creating a document database using services such as [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [AWS DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/), and others.

#### 3. Deploy

Run `fly launch` in the directory where you have the local version of config from step 1 and follow the instructions. 
Once done, your very own instance of Infisical should be up and running on Fly.io.

Please note that this version of Infisical requires at least 250MB of memory to operate smoothly.

<Info>
Once installation is complete, you will have to create the first account. No default account is provided.
