While most features in Infisical are free to use, others are paid and require purchasing an enterprise license to use them.

This guide walks through how you can use these paid features on a self hosted instance of Infisical.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Purchase a license">
        Start by either signing up for a free demo [here](https://infisical.com/schedule-demo) or contacting sales@infisical.com to purchase a license.

        Once purchased, you will be issued a license key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate the license">
        Depending on whether or not the environment where Infisical is deployed has internet access, you may be issued a regular license or an offline license.

        
        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Regular License">
            - Assign the issued license key to the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable in your Infisical instance.

            - Your Infisical instance will need to communicate with the Infisical license server to validate the license key. 
            If you want to limit outgoing connections only to the Infisical license server, you can use the following IP addresses: `13.248.249.247` and `35.71.190.59`

            <Note>
                Ensure that your firewall or network settings allow outbound connections to these IP addresses to avoid any issues with license validation.
            </Note>
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Offline License">
            - Assign the issued license key to the `LICENSE_KEY_OFFLINE` environment variable in your Infisical instance.

            <Note>
                How you set the environment variable will depend on the deployment method you used. Please refer to the documentation of your deployment method for specific instructions.
            </Note>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Once your instance starts up, the license key will be validated and youâ€™ll be able to use the paid features. 
        However, when the license expires, Infisical will continue to run, but EE features will be disabled until the license is renewed or a new one is purchased.
    </Step>
