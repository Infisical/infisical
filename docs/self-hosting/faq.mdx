This issue is typically seen when you haven't set up SSL for your self hosted instance of Infisical. When SSL is not enabled, you can't receive secure cookies, preventing the session data to not be saved.

To fix this, we highly recommend that you set up SSL for your instance. 
However, in the event you choose to use Infisical without SSL, you can do so by setting the `HTTPS_ENABLED` environment variable to `"false"` for the backend application.
