To meet various compliance requirements, you may want to self-host Infisical instead of using [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com/). 
Self-hosted Infisical allows you to maintain your sensitive information within your own infrastructure and network, ensuring complete control over your data. 
Choose from a variety of deployment options listed below to get started.
