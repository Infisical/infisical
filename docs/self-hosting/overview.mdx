description: "Learn how to self-host Infisical on your own infrastructure."
---

Self-hosting Infisical lets you retain data on your own infrastructure and network. Many organizations choose self-hosting for benefits in compliance and flexibility.

- Compliance: Deploying Infisical in your own environment helps meet strict regulatory requirements (e.g. SOC 2, HIPAA, FIPS 140-3) by aligning with your existing security controls. All data remains under your governance, and Infisical’s architecture supports compliance needs through strong encryption and access controls.
- Flexibility: You have complete control over deployment topology and integrations. Infisical can run in diverse environments. From air-gapped bare-metal servers to Kubernetes clusters or cloud VMs, this flexibility lets you tailor networking, security, and performance configurations to fit your organization’s needs.
