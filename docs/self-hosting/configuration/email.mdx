description: "How to configure your email when self-hosting Infisical."
---

By default, the core functions of Infisical work without any email service configuration. Without email service, basic sign up/login and secret operations will function without any issue.
However, the following functionality will be disabled.

- Multi-factor authentication
- Sending invite links via email for projects to teammates
- Sending alerts such as suspicious login attempts

## Configuration

If you choose to setup email service, you need to configure the following SMTP [environment variables](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/envars):

- `SMTP_HOST`: Hostname to connect to for establishing SMTP connections.
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Credential to connect to host (e.g. team@infisical.com)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Credential to connect to host.
- `SMTP_PORT`: Port to connect to for establishing SMTP connections.
- `SMTP_SECURE`: If `true`, the connection will use TLS when connecting to server with special configs for SendGrid and Mailgun. If `false` (the default) then TLS is used if server supports the STARTTLS extension.
- `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`: Email address to be used for sending emails (e.g. team@infisical.com).
- `SMTP_FROM_NAME`: Name label to be used in `From` field (e.g. Team).

Below you will find details on how to configure common email providers:

  will only work for Google Workspace or Google Cloud Identity customers as of May 30, 2022.
