---

Infisical requires you to configure your own SMTP server for certain functionality like:

- Sending email confirmation links to sign up.
- Sending invite links for projects.
- Sending alerts.

We strongly recommend using an email service to act as your email server and provide examples for common providers.

## General configuration

By default, you need to configure the following SMTP [environment variables](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/envars):

- `SMTP_HOST`: Hostname to connect to for establishing SMTP connections.
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Credential to connect to host (e.g. team@infisical.com)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Credential to connect to host.
- `SMTP_PORT`: Port to connect to for establishing SMTP connections.
- `SMTP_SECURE`: If `true`, the connection will use TLS when connecting to server with special configs for SendGrid and Mailgun. If `false` (the default) then TLS is used if server supports the STARTTLS extension.
- `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`: Email address to be used for sending emails (e.g. team@infisical.com).
- `SMTP_FROM_NAME`: Name label to be used in `From` field (e.g. Team).

Below you will find details on how to configure common email providers (not in any particular order).
