<Warning>
  Infisical offers Google SSO and GitHub SSO for free.
  
  Infisical also offers SAML SSO authentication but as paid features that can be unlocked via enterprise license; if this is of interest, please contact team@infisical.com.
  On this front, we currently support Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud and are expanding support for other IdPs in the coming months; stay tuned and feel free to request a IdP at this
  [issue](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues/442).
</Warning>
