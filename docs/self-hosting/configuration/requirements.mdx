This page details the minimum requirements necessary for installing and using Infisical. 
The actual resource requirements will vary in direct proportion to the operations performed by Infisical and the level of utilization by the end users.



## Deployment Sizes

**Small** suitable for most initial production setups, as well as development and testing scenarios.

**Large** suitable for high-demand production environments, characterized by either a high volume of transactions, large number of secrets, or both.


## Hardware Requirements

### Storage

Infisical doesn’t require file storage as all persisted data is saved in the database. 
However, its logs and metrics are saved to disk for later viewing. As a result, we recommend provisioning 1-2 GB of storage.

### CPU and Memory (Per Container/Instance)

Infisical is stateless and scales horizontally by running across multiple containers/instances. Each instance typically does **not** need more than **2–4 CPU cores** and **4–8 GB** of memory. 
If you need additional capacity, simply increase the **number** of containers/instances running in parallel.

| **Deployment Size** | **CPU (Cores, per container)** | **Memory (GB, per container)** | **Recommended Number of Containers** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Small**           | 2                              | 4                              | 2+                                   |
| **Medium**          | 2–4                            | 4–8                            | 5+                                   |
| **Large**           | 2–4                            | 4–8                            | 10+                                  |

> **Note:**  
> - Adding more containers (horizontal scaling) is generally the best way to handle spikes in secret operations.  
> - If you prefer, you can increase CPU/memory on a single container (vertical scaling), but horizontal scaling is more flexible and resilient.

## Database & caching layer

### Postgres

PostgreSQL is the only database supported by Infisical. Infisical has been extensively tested with Postgres version 16. We recommend using versions 14 and up for optimal compatibility.
The compute required for Postgres is largely dependent on the number of secret operations (reads and writes) you expect. The more frequently you read and write secrets, the more compute you will need.
You'll notice that storage requirements are high and this is because audit logs are by default stored in the database.


Recommended resource allocation based on deployment size. You may require more resources if you have a large number of secrets or high transaction volume:
- **small:** 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 100 GB Disk
- **medium:** 4vCPU / 16 GB RAM / 200 GB Disk
- **large:** 8vCPU / 32 GB RAM / 500 GB Disk

### Redis

Redis is utilized for session management and background tasks in Infisical.

Redis requirements:

- Use Redis versions 6.x or 7.x. We advise upgrading to at least Redis 6.2.
- Redis Cluster mode is currently not supported; use Redis Standalone, with or without High Availability (HA).
- Redis storage needs are minimal: a setup with 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, and 30GB SSD will be sufficient for small deployments.
- Set cache eviction policy to `noeviction`.

## Supported Web Browsers

Infisical supports a range of web browsers. However, features such as browser-based CLI login only work on Google Chrome and Firefox at the moment.
