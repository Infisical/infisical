Infisical uses rolling release channels to deliver new features, security fixes, and improvements with different update frequencies. 
This system allows you to balance getting the latest features with maintaining stability in your deployment environment.

## What are release channels?

Release channels define different schedules under which Infisical makes new releases available for you to deploy. 
Each channel operates on its own cadence, allowing you to choose how frequently you want to update your self-hosted deployment while balancing access to the latest features with your organization's stability requirements.


## Available Channels

Infisical provides two distinct release channels with different update frequencies and stability profiles.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Nightly Channel">
    - **Update Frequency**: Daily builds during weekdays (Monday-Friday)
    - **Versioning Strategy**: Nightly releases provide daily patches and features while making its way towards the next stable release
    - **Version Format**: `vX.Y.0-nightly-YYYYMMDD` where X.Y represents the next minor version increment from the latest stable release
    - **Multiple Daily Builds**: If multiple nightly builds are created on the same day, they are numbered incrementally: `vX.Y.0-nightly-YYYYMMDD.1`, `vX.Y.0-nightly-YYYYMMDD.2`, etc.
    - **Stability**: Latest features with standard CI/CD testing
    - **Release Process**: Built from main branch after all automated tests pass
