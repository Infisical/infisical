Infisical uses rolling release channels to deliver new features, security fixes, and improvements with different update frequencies. 
This system allows you to balance getting the latest features with maintaining stability in your deployment environment.

## What are release channels?

Release channels define different schedules under which Infisical makes new releases available for you to deploy. 
Each channel operates on its own cadence, allowing you to choose how frequently you want to update your self-hosted deployment while balancing access to the latest features with your organization's stability requirements.


## Available Channels

Infisical provides two distinct release channels with different update frequencies and stability profiles.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Nightly Channel">
    - **Update Frequency**: Daily builds during weekdays (Monday-Friday)
    - **Version Format**: `vX.Y.0-nightly-YYYYMMDD` where X.Y represents the next minor version increment from the latest stable release
    - **Versioning Strategy**: Nightly releases target the next scheduled minor version by incrementing from the current stable release and resetting the patch version to zero
    - **Multiple Daily Builds**: If multiple nightly builds are created on the same day, they are numbered incrementally: `vX.Y.Z-nightly-YYYYMMDD.1`, `vX.Y.Z-nightly-YYYYMMDD.2`, etc.
    - **Stability**: Latest features with standard CI/CD testing
    - **Release Process**: Built from main branch after all automated tests pass
    - **Intended Audience**: Development environments & early adopters

    **Best for:**
      - Organizations with flexible change management
      - Teams that want to test new features before they are made available via stable release channel 

      **Characteristics:**
      - Access to latest features immediately
      - Pre-release versions of upcoming stable releases
      - Faster security patch delivery

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stable Channel">

      - **Version Tags**: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v0.145.0`, `v0.146.0`)
      - **Stability**: Both code tested and production-proven releases
      - **Release Process**: Features validated through nightly channel for 30+ days
      - **Intended Audience**: Production environments, enterprise teams prioritizing stability

      **Best for:**
      - Enterprise environments with limited change windows
      - Organizations requiring predictable release cycles
      - Teams prioritizing stability and long-term support
