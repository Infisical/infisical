Feature: New Account
  Scenario: Create a new account
    Given I have an ACME cert profile as "acme_profile"
     When I have an ACME client connecting to {BASE_URL}/api/v1/pki/acme/profiles/{acme_profile.id}/directory
     Then I register a new ACME account with email fangpen@infisical.com and EAB key id {acme_profile.eab_kid} with secret {acme_profile.eab_secret} as acme_account
