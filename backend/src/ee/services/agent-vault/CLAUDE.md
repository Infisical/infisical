# Agent Vault backend

Read this before touching any `agent-vault-*` service or router. It holds only what the code does not say on
its own: the invariants that are easy to break and the decisions that are settled. Add a line when a reader
would get something wrong from the code alone; cut anything the code already states.

**Thesis.** An agent runs holding no credentials. Its HTTP traffic goes through a proxy we control, which
attaches the real credential on the way out. What an agent may reach lives in a **session** row on our side,
never in anything the agent holds.

| Noun | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Access bundle** | A named set of connections. The unit you grant |
| **Connection** | One host pattern set plus its credential |
| **Session** | A minted token naming one actor, one of their bundles, and an expiry. The token *is* the session |
| **Proxy** | One deployed egress node with its own CA. One row per box |

Routes: `ee/routes/v1/agent-vault-routers/`, prefix `/api/v1/agent-vault`. CLI: `packages/cmd/agent_vault*.go`
and `packages/agentvault/` in the CLI repo. Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/agent-vault/`,
`frontend/src/hooks/api/agentVault/`, `frontend/src/components/agent-vault/`.

## The project

- One implicit project per org, created lazily by the `injectAgentVaultProjectId` preValidation hook, so
  `GET /agent-vault/project` creates it on first access. That REST deviation is deliberate.
- Generic project create and delete are blocked for this type, and the project is excluded from
  `countOfBillableOrgProjects`. Break the exclusion and every org loses a workspace slot.
- Wherever code branches on `ProjectType.PAM`, add the Agent Vault arm: `AgentVaultIdentities` metering emits,
  the admin-or-member predefined roles filter, `AuditLogStreamProduct`, `grantAgentVaultAccess` on the org
  invite. See the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Grants and reachability

- A grant is a `memberships` row (`scope = resource`, `scopeResourceType = agent-vault-access-bundle`,
  `scopeResourceId = <bundle id>`) with one `membership_roles` row, slug `consumer`. The slug is a label;
  bundle access is decided in SQL, not CASL. Because it is the platform's table, the platform reaps grants
  on project removal, org removal, SCIM and every FK cascade. Do not add an Agent Vault reaper.
- `scopeResourceId` has no FK, so `deleteAccessBundle` deletes the bundle row first and then the grants in one
  transaction, and `addMembers` locks the bundle row (`lockByIdInProject`) before inserting. Keep that order.
- Granting is batch: one POST carries `members: [{ userId | identityId | groupId }]`. That lock is what makes
  the dedupe read inside it authoritative, so an actor who already holds the bundle is counted in
  `skippedCount` rather than erroring; the unique index is only the backstop.
- Reachability has one implementation, `findReachableAccessBundleIds` over the platform's
  `findResourceMembershipsForActor`, and mint, member-facing reads and resolve all call it. A group's grants
  count only while the group confers a live role (`liveGroupIdsFrom`). Write no group-expansion SQL here.
- Reachability is a service-layer filter (`whereIn` on ids, `null` for an admin), not a CASL condition:
  conditions can interpolate only `identity.id`, `username` and `metadata`.
- The creator grant exists only for a creator with a direct project membership. A group-inherited admin gets
  none, so no individual grant row ever outlives its owner's membership.
- A cross-org or ungranted id is 404, never 403, and mint uses one message for an unknown and an ungranted
  name, so the error never confirms a bundle exists.
- Mint is the only endpoint addressed by bundle name; every resource path stays on ids. It is the only one a
  human or the CLI hand-writes, and names are slugs unique per project, so the CLI posts the name straight
  through instead of resolving it first. PAM does the same with `path: "folderName/accountName"`.

## Sessions and resolve

- The token is the lookup key, so it is stored as sha256 (not bcrypt) and returned exactly once.
- V1 caps a session at one bundle: `AGENT_VAULT_MAX_SESSION_BUNDLES`, mirrored by the CLI's once-only check on
  `--access-bundle` and the single-select Create Session sheet. The mint body stays a list, the junction table
  keeps `position`, resolve orders by position then name, and the Go matcher breaks ties by slice order, so
  lifting the cap is those three places plus the copy that says one (the api-docs string, the service's cap
  message, the sheet and sessions page, the CLI help and the docs), not a migration.
- The bundle on a session is a ceiling fixed at mint and intersected with live reachability on every resolve.
  It can shrink and grow back, never past what was minted.
- Grants are read fresh on every resolve. The actor's role comes through the platform's permission cache
  (10 second marker), so a promotion or demotion can lag by that much on top of the proxy's poll.
- Resolve requires a live session-read permission, not a membership row: a lapsed time-limited role leaves
  its row behind, and `hasRole(Admin)` alone would fall through as member. An actor removed from the project
  surfaces as `ProjectMembershipNotFound`, which resolve turns into a 401 so the proxy drops the session on
  the next poll instead of riding its grace window.
- Removing an actor from Agent Vault does not revoke their sessions. The sessions resolve to nothing while
  the actor is out and work again if the actor is added back. Settled with the product owner.
- Status is derived from `revokedAt` and `expiresAt`, never stored, and expiry is enforced against the clock
  on every resolve. `sweepRetiredSessions` exists only for the 30 day hard delete; there is no expiry audit
  event, matching every other product.

## Proxies

- Infisical stores no copy of a proxy's CA, only the fingerprint and expiry. Agents fetch the CA from the
  proxy's own unauthenticated `/_agent-vault/ca`, so the trust path has no dependency on Infisical and there
  is deliberately no download endpoint.
- The enroll route is unauthenticated (the enrollment token is the credential), so its audit event names the
  proxy as actor explicitly, as gateway, relay and KMIP enrollment do. Otherwise it logs as `unknownUser`.
- The proxy's access token is non-expiring and revoked by bumping `tokenVersion`, which the auth plugin checks
  on every proxy request. Revoke Access goes through the shared resource-auth revoke so a pending enrollment
  token is burned too.
- Resolve is not audited: once per poll per session would swamp the audit table.

## Host grammar

`agent-vault-host-pattern.ts` is the grammar of record. The CLI matcher (`packages/agentvault/match.go`) does
the matching at runtime and reimplements the same rules, so a change here needs the same change there.

- Paths are rejected: the matcher would compare the decoded path while the upstream gets the escaped one.
- A portless pattern means 443. An explicit port is allowed, `:80` included, so the proxy must also refuse
  to inject over plaintext, and it does.
- A wildcard is the leftmost label only and matches exactly one label. This is what makes every pattern pair
  identical, contained or disjoint, which is what makes conflict detection exact. Do not loosen it.
- Conflict detection is an intersection over individual patterns, because `hostPattern` is a comma-separated
  set. Same bundle: hard reject. Across bundles: allowed, since a session carries one bundle they never meet.
- Patterns are stored as typed and normalised at match time. `*.com` is accepted; settled as not a bug.

## Credentials at rest

- The KMS cipher pair is project-scoped (`KmsDataKey.SecretManager`) and built once per resolve.
- `credentialType` is a column and `credentialConfig` the plaintext half (header name, prefix), so a list page
  renders without a decrypt and a new credential type is a config entry, not a migration. For basic, the
  username is sealed with the password: some services put the whole key in the username.
- A connection update is a patch. `AgentVaultCredentialUpdateSchema` makes every field optional and
  `mergeCredential` overlays what arrived. Never reuse `AgentVaultBearerConfigSchema` on that path: its
  `.default()`s would reset an omitted `headerName` to `Authorization`.
- The sealed secret has three write states: a value re-seals, `null` clears it (passthrough), `undefined`
  leaves it alone. `$decryptCredential` reads NULL as passthrough, so a bearer row that lost its secret would
  silently stop attaching a credential.

## The CLI

- Trust is stateless: `av run` fetches the CA from the proxy on every run; `--ca-fingerprint` is an optional
  pin checked before anything is written. Re-enrolling a proxy replaces its CA, so pins, mounted copies,
  keychain entries and any agent already running through it break until updated or restarted.
- No sandbox, nothing stripped. The agent gets the parent's whole environment plus the proxy URL (session
  token inside) and the CA trust variables. Settled with the product owner.
- The session flag is `--session-token`, not `--token`, so the root command's Infisical-token handling never
  reads it. The minting identity comes from `--client-id`/`--client-secret`, the access-token env vars, or the
  keyring login.
- The proxy exits after two consecutive heartbeat 401s: only Revoke Access, a deleted record or a changed
  signing secret produce one, and every session on it is dead at that point. Timeouts and 5xx ride the
  five-poll grace window and reset the counter.
- The enrollment dialog's Docker snippet mounts `/etc/infisical/agent-vault` (the root data dir). Without it a
  re-created container has no CA and a spent token.

## The frontend

- Admin is a role check on both sides, `hasRole(ProjectMembershipRole.Admin)`, not a CASL check. It decides
  the projected API shapes (`members` omitted from a bundle, settings omitted from a proxy) and the UI branches.
- The service template catalog (`helpers/agentVaultTemplates.ts`) is frontend-only and never persisted; icons
  re-derive from the stored host pattern. The backend must never learn a service name.
- Docs links live in `pages/agent-vault/agent-vault-docs-urls.ts`; keep them pointing at existing pages.
