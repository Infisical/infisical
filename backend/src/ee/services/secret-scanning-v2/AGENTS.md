# Secret scanning scans and GitHub pull request checks

Read before changing scan triggers, `secret-scanning-v2-queue.ts`, or the GitHub pull request check flow.

- A scan's `trigger` (`SecretScanningScanTrigger`) records what started it, separate from `type` (`historical` /
  `realtime`). `metadata` (jsonb) holds trigger-specific data, is parsed by trigger, and is never returned raw by
  the API.
- `secret-scanning-v2-queue.ts` stays provider-agnostic. Provider behavior goes behind optional hooks on the data
  source factory (`getRealtimeScanReport` / `getScanReport` for reporting a scan back, `processEvent` for webhook
  events beyond pushes), never behind a provider check in the queue.
- PR checks are realtime scans with `trigger: pull-request`, gated on `isScanNewCommitsEnabled`. Webhook handlers
  only enqueue; `processGitHubPullRequestEvent` does the work. The check run is created before the scan, with the
  scan's ID as its `external_id`, which is how re-runs and skip actions find the scan.
- Every exit of a PR scan closes its check (including the stuck-scan reaper, which also fails realtime scans left
  `queued`), since a check left open blocks merging when it is required.
- A PR scan that can't finish fails its check, so an outage never lets a secret through. What GitHub's API can't
  provide (commits past the compare limit, files past the 3,000 a commit lists, a missing patch for a file over
  `MISSING_PATCH_MAX_FILE_BYTES`) is skipped and listed on the check instead, which concludes `neutral` when nothing
  else fails it, because re-running never changes those.
- Fork PRs aren't scanned: they get a `skipped` check under the same name, unless the commit already has one of
  our checks (checks belong to the commit, so it would replace a real result).
