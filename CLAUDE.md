# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential Commands

- `make reviewable-api` / `make reviewable-ui` — lint:fix + type:check (run before PRs)
- `cd backend && npm run migration:new` — create new DB migration
- `cd backend && npm run generate:schema` — regenerate Zod types from DB after migration changes
- `cd backend-go && make gen-goa` — regenerate Goa HTTP handlers from DSL
- `cd backend-go && make gen-db` — regenerate go-jet table types from DB
- `cd backend-go && make test` — run Go integration tests

Both backend and frontend use `@app/*` as path alias to `./src/*`.

## Repository Structure

Infisical is an open-source secret management platform. Monorepo layout:

```

- **`backend/`** — Fastify 4 API server, TypeScript, PostgreSQL via Knex, BullMQ queues. See [`backend/CLAUDE.md`](backend/CLAUDE.md) for architecture, patterns, and commands.
- **`backend-go/`** — Go API server (partial rewrite), Goa v3 for API design, go-jet for type-safe SQL, same PostgreSQL database. See [`backend-go/CLAUDE.md`](backend-go/CLAUDE.md) for architecture, patterns, and commands.
- **`frontend/`** — React 18 SPA, Vite 6, TanStack Router + React Query, Tailwind CSS v4. See [`frontend/CLAUDE.md`](frontend/CLAUDE.md) for architecture, patterns, and commands.
- **`docs/`** — Product documentation site. Has its own Dockerfile for building. Reference docs for up-to-date feature descriptions and API usage.

Enterprise features live in `backend/src/ee/` (services and routes), registered before community routes so they can override/extend them.

### Self-Hosted Deployment

Infisical supports self-hosted deployment via Docker. Key considerations:
- **`Dockerfile.standalone-infisical`** — single-container image with both frontend and backend; used for simple deployments.
- **`Dockerfile.fips.standalone-infisical`** — FIPS 140-2 compliant variant for regulated environments. Be strict about not introducing dependencies that break FIPS compliance.
- **`docker-compose.prod.yml`** — production compose with backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
- New backend dependencies should be evaluated carefully — they affect container size, FIPS compliance, and the encryption boundary. Check `docs/` for self-hosted deployment documentation when in doubt.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

### Auth & Permissions

Auth modes (JWT, IDENTITY_ACCESS_TOKEN, SCIM_TOKEN, MCP_JWT) are extracted in `backend/src/server/plugins/auth/`. Authorization uses CASL (`@casl/ability`) with project-level and org-level permission checks — see `backend/CLAUDE.md` for backend details and `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for frontend permission hooks/HOCs. Note: `API_KEY` and `SERVICE_TOKEN` auth modes are deprecated — do not use them in new code.

### Service Factory + Manual DI (Backend)

No IoC container in either backend. Every service is a factory function with explicit dependencies.
- **Node.js**: Wired in `backend/src/server/routes/index.ts` — see `backend/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Go**: Wired in `backend-go/internal/services/services.go` via `NewRegistry()` — see `backend-go/CLAUDE.md`.

### API Layer (Frontend)

React Query + Axios with query key factories per domain. Each API domain in `frontend/src/hooks/api/` has `queries.tsx`, `mutations.tsx`, and `types.tsx` — see `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for conventions.

## Keeping CLAUDE.md Up to Date

When making significant changes to the codebase (new services, architectural shifts, new patterns, major refactors), update the relevant CLAUDE.md file(s) with high-level findings. This includes this root file for cross-cutting concerns, `backend/CLAUDE.md` for Node.js backend changes, `backend-go/CLAUDE.md` for Go backend changes, and `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for frontend changes. The goal is to keep these files accurate as living documentation so future sessions start with correct context.

## Wiring a New Full-Stack Feature

1. **Backend**: Create service module, migration, wire DI, add routes — see checklist in `backend/CLAUDE.md`
2. **Frontend**: Add API hooks in `src/hooks/api/<domain>/`, create page/view, wire route — see `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for routing and component patterns
3. Run `make reviewable-api` and `make reviewable-ui` before submitting
