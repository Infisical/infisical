**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is an open source, E2EE tool to help teams manage and sync environment variables across their development workflow and infrastructure. It's designed to be simple and take minutes to get going.

- **Navigate Multiple Environments** per project (e.g. development, staging, production, etc.)
- **Personal/Shared** scoping for environment variables
- **[Integrations](https://infisical.com/docs/Heroku)** with CI/CD and production infrastructure (Heroku available, more coming soon)
- 🔜 **1-Click Deploy** to Digital Ocean and Heroku
- 🔜 **Authentication/Authorization** for projects (read/write controls soon)
- 🔜 **Automatic Secret Rotation**
- 🔜 **2FA**
- 🔜 **Access Logs**
- 🔜 **Slack Integration & MS Teams** integrations

And more.

## Get started

To quickly get started, visit our [get started guide](https://infisical.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

## Stay Up-to-Date

Infisical officially launched as v.1.0 on November 21st, 2022. However, a lot of new features are coming very quickly. Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified about future updates:

![infisical-star-github](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/blob/main/.github/images/star-infisical.gif?raw=true)

## What's cool about this?

Infisical is simple, E2EE, and (soon to be) complete.

According to a [report](https://www.ekransystem.com/en/blog/secrets-management) in 2019, only 10% of organizations use secret management solutions despite all using digital secrets to some extent.

We're on a mission to make secret management more accessible to everyone — that means building for developers, not just security teams.

If you care about efficiency and security, then Infisical is right for you.

Need any integrations or want a new feature? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues) or [contribute](https://infisical.com/docs/contributing) directly to the repository.

## Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [infisical.com](https://infisical.com) but go easy on us, there are kinks and we're just getting started.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

We're currently in Public Alpha.

## Integrations

We're currently setting the foundation and building integrations so secrets can be synced everywhere. Any help is welcome! :)

- [x] Docker
- [x] Docker Compose
- [x] Heroku
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] AWS
- [ ] GCP
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] Digital Ocean
- [ ] GitLab
- [ ] CircleCI

## Open-source vs. paid

This repo is entirely MIT licensed, with the exception of the `ee` directory which will contain premium enterprise features requring a Infisical license in the future. We're currently focused on developing non-enterprise offerings first that should suit most use-cases.

## Security

Looking to report a security vulnerability? Please don't post about it in GitHub issue. Instead, refer to our [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) file.
