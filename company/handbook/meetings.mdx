## "Let's schedule a meeting about this"

Being a remote-first company, we try to be as async as possible. When an issue arises, it's best to create a public Slack thread and tag all the necessary team members. Otherwise, if you were to "put a meeting on a calendar", the decision making process will inevitable slow down by at least a day (e.g., trying to find the right time for folks in different time zones is not always straightforward). 

In other words, we have almost no (recurring) meetings and prefer written communication or quick Slack huddles.

## Weekly All-hands

All-hands is the single recurring meeting that we run every Monday at 8:30am PT. Typically, we would discuss everything important that happened during the previous week and plan out the week ahead. This is also an opportunity to bring up any important topics in front of the whole company (but feel free to post those in Slack too).
