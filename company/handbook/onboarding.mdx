Welcome to Infisical! 

The first few days of every new joiner are going to be packed with learning lots of new information, meeting new teammates, and understanding Infisical on a deeper level. 

Plus, our team is remote-first and spread across the globe (from San Francisco to Philippines), so having a great onboarding experience is very important for the new joiner to feel part of the team and be excited about what we're doing as a company.

## Onboarding buddy

Every new joiner has an onboarding buddy who should ideally be in the the same timezone. The onboarding buddy should be able to help with any questions that pop up during the first few weeks. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it&apos;s good to have a dedicated person that you can go to with any questions.

## Onboarding Checklist

1. Join the weekly all-hands meeting. It typically happens on Monday's at 8:30am PT.
2. Ship something together on day one – even if tiny! It feels great to hit the ground running, with a development environment all ready to go.
3. Check out the [Areas of Responsibility (AoR) Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RnXlGFg83Sgu0dh7ycuydsSobmFfI3A0XkGw7vrVxEI/edit?usp=sharing). This is helpful to know who you can ask about particular areas of Infisical. Feel free to add yourself to the areas you'd be most interesting to dive into.
4. Read the [Infisical Strategy Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaJd3RoS2QpWLFHlgfHaXnHqCCwRt6mCGZkbJ75J_D0/edit?usp=sharing).
5. Update your LinkedIn profile with one of [Infisical's official banners](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oSNWjbpRl9oNYwxM_98IqzKs9fAskrb2) (if you want to). You can also coordinate your social posts in the #marketing Slack channel, so that we can boost it from Infisical's official social media accounts.
6. Over the first few weeks, feel free to schedule 1:1s with folks on the team to get to know them a bit better.
7. Change your Slack username in the users channel to `[NAME] (Infisical)`.
8. Go through the [technical overview](https://infisical.com/docs/internals/overview) of Infisical. 
9. Request a company credit card (Maidul will be able to help with that).
