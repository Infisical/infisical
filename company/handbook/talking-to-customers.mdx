---

Everyone at Infisical talks to customers directly. We do this for a few reasons: 
1. This helps us understand the needs of our customers and build the product they want.
2. This speeds up our iteration cycles (time from customer feedback to product improvements). 
3. Our customers (developers) are able to talk directly to the best experts in Infisical (us) â€“ which improves their satisfaction and success.

## Customer Communication Etiquette

1. When talking to customers (no matter whether it's on Slack, email, or any other channel), it is very important to use proper grammar (e.g., no typos, no missed question marks) and minimal colloquial language (no "yeap", "yah", etc.). 
2. At the time of a crisis (e.g., customer-reported bug), it is very important to communicate often. Even if there is no update yet, it is good to reach out to the customer and let them know that we are still working on resolving a certain issue.

## Community Slack

Unfortunately, we are not able to help everyone in the community Slack. It is OK to politely decline questions about infrastructure management that are not directly related to the product itself.
