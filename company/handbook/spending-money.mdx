Fairly frequently, you might run into situations when you need to spend company money. 


# Expensing Meals

As a perk of working at Infisical, we cover some of your meal expenses.

**HQ team members**: meals and unlimited snacks are provided **on-site** at no cost.

**Remote team members**: a food stipend is allocated based on location.

# Trivial expenses

We don't want you to be slowed down because you're waiting for an approval to purchase some SaaS. For trivial expenses – **Just do it**.

This means expenses that are: 
1. Non-recurring AND less than $75/month in total.
2. Recurring AND less than $20/month. 

<Note>
Please spend money in a way that you think is in the best interest of the company.

# Travel

If you need to travel on Infisical’s behalf for in-person onboarding, meeting customers, and offsites, again please spend money in the best interests of the company.

We do not pre-approve your travel expenses, and trust team members to make the right decisions here. Some guidance:

- Please find a flight ticket that is reasonably priced. We all travel economy by default – we cannot afford for folks to fly premium or business class. Feel free to upgrade using your personal money/airmiles if you’d like to.
- Feel free to pay for the Uber/subway/bus to and from the airport with your Brex card. 
- For business travel, Infisical will cover reasonable expenses for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  
- When traveling internationally, Infisical does not cover roaming charges for your phone. You can expense a reasonable eSIM, which usually is no more than $20.

<Note>
Note that this only applies to business travel. It is not applicable for personal travel or day-to-day commuting.

# Equipment

Infisical is a remote first company so we understand the importance of having a comfortable work setup. To support this, we provide allowances for essential office equipment.

### 1. Desk & Chair

Most people already have a comfortable desk and chair, but if you need an upgrade, we offer the following allowances. 
While we're not yet able to provide the latest and greatest, we strive to be reasonable given the stage of our company.

**Desk**: $150 USD

**Chair**: $150 USD

### 2. Laptop
Each team member will receive a company-issued Macbook Pro before they start their first day.

### 3. Notes

1. All equipment purchased using company allowances remains the property of Infisical.
2. Keep all receipts for equipment purchases and submit them for reimbursement.
3. If you leave Infisical, you may be required to return company-owned equipment.

Please note that we're unable to offer a split payment option where the Infisical pays half and you pay half for equipment exceeding the allowance. 
This is because we don't yet have a formal HR department to handle such logistics.

For any equipment related questions, please reach out to Maidul.


# Brex

We use Brex as our primary credit card provider. Don't have a company card yet? Reach out to Maidul. 

### Budgets

You will generally have multiple budgets assigned to you. "General Company Expenses" primarily covers quick SaaS purchases (not food). Remote team members should have a "Lunch Stipend" budget that applies to food.

If your position involves a lot of travel, you may also have a "Travel" budget that applies to expenses related to business travel (e.g., you can not use it for transportation or food during personal travel).

### Saving receipts

Make sure you keep copies for all receipts. If you expense something on a company card and cannot provide a receipt, this may be deducted from your pay.

You should default to using your company card in all cases - it has no transaction fees. If using your personal card is unavoidable, please reach out to Maidul to get it reimbursed manually.

### ​Need a one-off budget increase? 

You can do this directly within Brex - just request the amount and duration for the relevant budget in the app, and your hiring manager will automatically be notified for approval.


# Training

For engineers, you’re welcome to take an approved Udemy course. Please reach out to Maidul. For the GTM team, you may buy a book a month if it’s relevant to your work.
