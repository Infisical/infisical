We offer eveyone at Infisical unlimited time off. We care about your results, not how long you work.

To request time off, just submit a request in Rippling and let Maidul know at least a week in advance. 

## National holidays

Since Infisical's team is globally distributed, it is hard for us to keep track of all the various national holidays across many different countries. Whether you'd like to celebrate Christmas or National Brisket Day (which, by the way, is on May 28th), you are welcome to take PTO on those days – just let Maidul know at least a week ahead so that we can adjust our planning. 

## Winter Break 

Every year, Infisical team goes on a company-wide vacation during winter holidays. This year, the winter break period starts on December 21st, 2024 and ends on January 5th, 2025. You should expect to do no scheduled work during this period, but we will have a rotation process for [high and urgent service disruptions](https://infisical.com/sla).
